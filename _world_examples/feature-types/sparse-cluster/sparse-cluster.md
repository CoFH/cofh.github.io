Clusters and Sparse Clusters are very similar, so for this example we've left every value identical to the Cluster example **except for** the only value which acts differently - `cluster-size`.

You may [read the documentation](docs/cofh-world/world-generator-configuration/feature-types/sparse-cluster/) for Sparse Clusters to learn more.
