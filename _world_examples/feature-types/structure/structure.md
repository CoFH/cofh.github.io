This is an example of spawning structures.

Do note that you'll need <a href="/assets/other/example_structure.nbt" target="_blank">the example structure NBT file</a>, or to create your own using structure blocks and to call it `example_structure.nbt` (see `structure` in the JSON).

{% include notice.html notice="The NBT file will need to be placed in the same directory as the JSON file." %}
