<p>
    Thermal Dynamics is the mod in the 'Thermal' series that is all about transport. It contains completely rewritten versions of the well-known Ducts that were once in <a href="/mods/thermal-expansion">Thermal Expansion</a>. They were moved to their own mod as a means to organize the content better (and to get Thermal Expansion released within a reasonable timespan).
