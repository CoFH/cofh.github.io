title: Custom World Generation
---

<p>
    CoFH Core includes a powerful customizable world generator. Using this feature, users or modpack authors can specify their own ores, plants, boulders, spikes, lakes, dungeons and more to generate in their worlds.
</p>

<p>
    <strong>Note:</strong> A good understanding of the JSON markup language is recommended. A description of the JSON syntax can be found <a href="http://www.w3schools.com/json/json_syntax.asp" target="_blank">here</a>.
</p>

<h2 id="file-structure">File structure</h2>
<hr />

<p>
    Custom world generation is specified using JSON files in the folder <dfn>[minecraft instance]\config\cofh\world</dfn>.<br />
    <img class="uk-margin" src="/images/worldgen-folder.png" /><br />
    By default, this folder contains one or two files: <dfn>Vanilla.json</dfn> and possibly <dfn>ThermalExpansion-Ores.json</dfn>. The latter is only added when Thermal Expansion is present.
</p>

<p>These files can be freely edited to change the default types of world generation. It is also possible to add new files to be read by CoFH Core. This is not required when adding more world generation types, but can improve human readability. Furthermore, new folders that contain more files can be added in the 'world' folder, as it is read recursively.</p>

<p>Any errors that are found in the files will be logged while the game starts. Be sure to check the log if generation is not working as intended.</p>

<p>
    <strong>Note 1:</strong> Editing Vanilla.json will only have effect if the option B:ReplaceVanillaGeneration is enabled in CoFH Core's main configuration file.<br />
    <strong>Note 2:</strong> When adding a new file to the folder, make sure that the file has the .json extension.
</p>

<h2 id="format">Format</h2>
<hr />

<p>This section explains the format that CoFH Core reads custom world generation files in.</p>

<p>Every world generation file contains a root Object, which in turn contains values that describe the actual world generation types themselves. These values are also Objects, and will from now on be called <dfn>entries</dfn>.</p>

<p>
    As an example of the format, see the <a href="http://pastebin.com/mc4C6qLH" target="_blank">default Vanilla.json file</a>.<br />
    It can be seen here that the <dfn>template</dfn> value is the first value to be set on every entry. This is because the template is the most important value in an entry, and determines some of the other values that can or need to be set.
</p>

<p>
    The <dfn>template</dfn> value describes how the generation of groups of blocks is distributed. A generator, which actually generates the blocks, can also be defined here.<br />
    The template also specifies what other values are needed in an entry.
</p>

<p>The value of <dfn>template</dfn> can be either an Object or a String value.</p>

<p>If specified as an Object, said Object can contain the following values.</p>
<table class="uk-table uk-table-striped uk-text-small">
    <thead>
        <tr>
            <th>Name</th>
            <th>Required</th>
            <th>Type</th>
            <th>Default</th>
            <th>Description</th>
        </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
        <tr>
            <td>type</td>
            <td>Yes</td>
            <td>String</td>
            <td>N/A</td>
            <td>The type of template to use. Possible template types can be found under 'Template types'.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>generator</td>
            <td>No</td>

            <td>The type of generator to use. Possible generator types can be found under 'Generator types'.</td>
        </tr>
    </tbody>
</table>
<p>Generator types may require additional values to be set. These values must be set in the template object as well.</p>

<p>If specified as a String, the <dfn>type</dfn> value seen above can be used directly.</p>

<p>After the template has been set, it is time to configure the other values in the entry. Some values can or need to be added to every entry, and some values only can or need to be added for specific template types.</p>

<h2 id="common-values">Common values</h2>
<hr />

<p>These values can be added to every entry regardless of template type.</p>

                The <dfn>normal</dfn> template is mostly the same as the <dfn>uniform</dfn> template. The only difference is the height distribution. Instead of an uniform distribution between a minimum and a maximum height, it has a normal distribution, meaning it is more likely to generate near the mean height than it is to generate near the set height limits.<br />
                Minecraft generates Lapis Lazuli Ore with this kind of height distribution.

                <strong>Note:</strong> This template could be mistaken to be the 'normal' or standard template for generating ores. This is not the case, as the name refers to normal distribution. The most commonly used template for ores is <dfn>uniform</dfn>.

                The <dfn>fractal</dfn> template generates groups of blocks together in larger clusters, also called 'veins' in its options. Essentially, the 'veins' define general areas for groups of blocks to generate in.<br />
                This template is can be used to generate enormous veins of ore, or other kinds of blocks.

                The <dfn>cluster</dfn> generator creates 'blobs' of blocks. This template is most commonly used for generating basic ore veins.<br />
                Minecraft generates ores and dirt/gravel pockets like this.
            </p>

            <ul>
                <li>
                    The <dfn>clusterSize</dfn> value in entries determines how large the blobs are. However, it is hard to determine how exactly it affects the amount of blocks generated. It is capped at 32, and will be interpreted as 32 if it has a higher number.<br />
                    For reference, have a look in the <a href="http://pastebin.com/mc4C6qLH" target="_blank">default Vanilla.json file</a> to see examples of <dfn>clusterSize</dfn> values, and what the results of those entries are.
                </li>

        </li>
        <li>
            <p>
                The <dfn>sparse-cluster</dfn> generator is mostly the same as the <dfn>cluster</dfn> generator, with one notable exception. When using very small <dfn>clusterSize</dfn> values in entries (about 4 or less), clusters will only have a certain chance to actually generate, instead of generating a single block or so every time. At 3, 1 in 3 clusters will actually generate. At 2 it is 1 in 6 clusters, and at 1 it is 1 in 12 clusters.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>
                The <dfn>large-vein</dfn> generator can be used to create veins that have a (much) larger <dfn>clusterSize</dfn> than the <dfn>cluster</dfn> generator can handle.
            </p>

            <ul>
                <li>The <dfn>clusterSize</dfn> value in entries determines roughly how large veins are. Unlike <dfn>cluster</dfn>, there is no cap specified here. Use with caution.</li>

                        <td>Used to determine the shape and density of veins. If true, veins will be smaller and more spread out, and will look somewhat like neurons. The <dfn>clusterSize</dfn> value in entries then determines roughly how many blocks a single vein contains. If false, veins will be much larger and more dense, somewhat closer to how the <dfn>cluster</dfn> generator works. It is also hard to predict how the <dfn>clusterSize</dfn> value affects the resulting amount of blocks in this case, but it seems to be tied exponentially.</td>

                The <dfn>decoration</dfn> generator creates groups of blocks scattered around on surfaces.<br />

                The <dfn>lake</dfn> generator creates ponds of (usually) fluid blocks, carving out space if needed in the process.<br />
                Minecraft generates this kind of 'lakes' using water or lava, both on the surface and underground.

                The <dfn>spike</dfn> generator creates simple upward-pointing spikes. Large spikes may also be generated, which are the same as normal spikes, except with a tall column of blocks as filler added in somewhere. The spikes also have some kind of 'roots' below them that extends a few blocks into the surface they are generated on.<br />
                This kind of generation is used by Minecraft to generate the spikes in the Ice Plains Spikes biome.
