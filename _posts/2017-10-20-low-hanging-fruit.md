So for the past week or so, I've decided to focus on some "low hanging fruit,"
although it probably isn't really fair to call it that. These are just some of
the things that I've wanted to add to Thermal Expansion for a while. So on a
high level, I wanted to tackle two vanilla systems that Thermal Expansion hasn't
had any interaction with:

- Brewing
- Enchanting

And in doing so, I actually ended up knocking out a few more requests along the
way. At the moment I'm still doing internal testing, but when the next TE patch
is released for 1.12, it will be one of the largest in a long time. Off the top
of my head, it will contain:

### **New Machines:**
- Alchemical Imbuer
-- This brews potions, in fluid form. You can chain a bunch of them together.
- Arcane Ensorcellator
-- An enchanter, requires a book, item, and Essence of Knowledge (fluid XP).

### **New Devices:**
- Fluid Allocator
-- Like the Item Allocator, except with fluids. Three tanks, all lockable.
- Lexical Transmuter
-- Forge Lexicon in Block form. Remembers up to 9 distinct items.
- Insightful Condenser
-- An XP collecting block which can provide bonus XP if fed lapis or soul sand.
- Decoctive Diffuser
-- A block which spreads a potion effect over a small area. Uses fluid potions.

Along with all this, there are new Augments coming. Seven (7) of them at the
moment, but if I get more coded before release, then who knows.

There's also a small rework to the Phytogenic Insolator. I decided to remove the
"Substrate" augments as they did not really provide any extra gameplay. I've
also adjusted the recipe balance of the machine somewhat.

Obviously, XP and Potions are added as Fluids, if that wasn't apparent. They
have full support in the Fluid Transposer and Fractionating Still, of course.

And there's JEI support, naturally.
