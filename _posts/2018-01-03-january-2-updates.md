On January 2, new updates were released for [CoFH Core](/docs/1.12/cofh-core/), the
[Thermal Series](/docs/#thermal-series) and [Redstone
Arsenal](/docs/1.12/redstone-arsenal/).

#### General
* Various refactors and bugfixes (see the [issue
  tracker](https://github.com/CoFH/Feedback/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aclosed+label%3Afixed+sort%3Aupdated-desc)).

#### Thermal Foundation
* Added [block of charcoal](/docs/1.12/thermal-foundation/block-of-charcoal/) and [block of coal
  coke](/docs/1.12/thermal-foundation/block-of-coal-coke/).
* [Tomes of knowledge](/docs/1.12/thermal-foundation/tome-of-knowledge/) now once again take and give
  one level of experience at a time when used.
* [Oil sand](/docs/1.12/thermal-foundation/oil-sand/) and [oil shale](/docs/1.12/thermal-foundation/oil-shale/) can now be
  harvested with a shovel. A pickaxe will still work, though.
* Fluid ores no longer spill fluids when harvested with Silk Touch.
* Crafting clay using [slag](/docs/1.12/thermal-foundation/slag/) now yields 4 clay instead of 2.

#### Thermal Expansion
* [Morbs](/docs/1.12/thermal-expansion/morb/)
  * Throwable items that can be used to capture and release mobs. (Thanks
    [ImbaKnugel](https://github.com/ImbaKnugel))
  * These will be expanded on in the future. <small>(mob processing)</small>
* [Void satchel](/docs/1.12/thermal-expansion/satchel/)
  * A special type of satchel that destroys any items put into it.
  * Can be useful when paired with [auto-collect](/docs/1.12/thermal-expansion/satchel/#auto-collect).
* [Satchel](/docs/1.12/thermal-expansion/satchel/) contents can now only be dumped into inventories
  while sneaking.
* [Induction smelters](/docs/1.12/thermal-expansion/induction-smelter/) now smelt one metal dust at a
  time for 500 RF, instead of two at a time for 800 RF.

#### Thermal Dynamics
* [Redstone Relay](/docs/1.12/thermal-dynamics/redstone-relay/)
  * This was gone for a while, but it's back now. (Thanks
    [ImbaKnugel](https://github.com/ImbaKnugel))
  * Transmits redstone signals through a duct network.
  * Can be in one of 16 channels.
