We're in a good spot.

At the moment, we've just pushed new builds for most of the 1.12 mods, the
issue tracker is devoid of all verifiable bugs, and there are a lot of things
which we're sort of considering. They aren't guaranteed to be implemented in any
way.

So with 1.12 in a fairly good place, what's next?

- Personally, I want to focus on Thermal Expansion. There's a really long to-do
list for that and a quite a few things I really want to add. I want to make sure
that it sticks to a theme, and is internally consistent as well as balanced in a
larger modded environment. So basically, I want to make it an even better as an
automation workhorse.

- There are a couple of things which I'd like to handle with Thermal Dynamics,
but that may require a bit of refactoring. In general, we're happy with the
current implementation but there's always room for improvement.

- Thermal Cultivation is in an odd place. Yes, it's just Watering Cans right
now, but there's a reason for that. I have a fairly comprehensive architecture
in mind, however 1.13 means that IDs and metadata may be going away. While this
isn't a huge issue, it's something that we'll have to plan around.

- Thermal Foundation will be updated as required to support whatever I have
planned for the rest of the Thermal series. :)

- People keep asking for a Quarry / Pump, and while it's something we wish to
implement, it probably won't be in an existing mod, simply to avoid cluttering
things up. Possibly look for a "Thermal Excavation" in the future. I also like
the idea of some multiblock implementations of these.

- Tesseracts. There's a design doc. I'm still thinking about it. I admit that I
am torn between executing my original vision for them or just going full-on
ridiculously overpowered so that people who wish for complete logistical
triviality can have it. Either way, don't expect them in Thermal Expansion, as
they don't really mesh with the rest of the mod. (Unless I add a LOT of ender
technology to it.)
