![Silver ore](/images/docs/1.12/thermal-foundation/ore-silver.png){:style="height: 128px"}


**Silver ore** is a somewhat uncommon [ore](https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Ore)
that yields [silver](../silver-ingot/) and small amounts of
[lead](../lead-ingot/).


Obtaining
---------

Silver ore is less common than [iron
ore](https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Iron_Ore), but more common than [gold
ore](https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Gold_Ore). It occurs at low levels in the
world (layers 5-30). Silver ore veins are slightly smaller than iron ore veins,
and may contain one or two blocks of [lead ore](../lead-ore/) as well.
Similarly, lead ore veins may contain one or two blocks of silver ore.

Silver ore must be mined with an [iron
pickaxe](https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Pickaxe) or better. If it is mined, it
drops itself as an item.

  [configuration](../../cofh-world/world-generator-configuration/).
