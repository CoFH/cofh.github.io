**Seed oil** is a fluid obtained from various kinds of seeds. It can be used to
turn [pulped biomass](../pulped-biomass/) into [rich
biomass](../rich-biomass/) and [pulped
bioblend](../pulped-bioblend/) into [rich
bioblend](../rich-bioblend/). It can also be used as fuel
in a [compression dynamo](../../thermal-expansion/compression-dynamo/).
