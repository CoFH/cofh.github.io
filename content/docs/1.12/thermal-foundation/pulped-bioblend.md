**Pulped bioblend** is a material obtained by mixing [pulped
biomass](../pulped-biomass/) and
[sawdust](../sawdust/). It can be processed into
[biocrude](../biocrude/), which can then be processed into
[grassoline](../grassoline/). Using bioblend allows for
more biocrude to be produced from the same amount of biomass.
