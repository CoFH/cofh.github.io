**Nickel ore** is an uncommon [ore](https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Ore) that
yields [nickel](../nickel-ingot/) and small amounts of
[platinum](../platinum-ingot/).


Obtaining
---------

Nickel ore is about as common as [gold
ore](https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Gold_Ore), but it occurs at fewer levels
(layers 5-20). Veins of nickel ore are also relatively small.

Nickel ore must be mined with an [iron
pickaxe](https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Pickaxe) or better. If it is mined, it
drops itself as an item.

### Induction Smelter

### Smashing
When nickel ore is broken using a [Smashing](../../cofh-core/smashing/)
enchanted [pickaxe](https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Pickaxe) or similar tool,
two piles of [pulverized nickel](../pulverized-nickel/)
are dropped instead of the ore.


Trivia
------

* Nickel ore is generated in the world using [CoFH World](../../cofh-world/) by
  default. The world generation can be tweaked or disabled using CoFH World's
  [configuration](../../cofh-world/world-generator-configuration/).
