**Bitumen** is a material obtained from [oil sand](../oil-sand/) and [oil
shale](../oil-shale/). It can be processed into [crude
oil](../crude-oil/).


Obtaining

### Mining
[Oil sand](../oil-sand/) and [oil shale](../oil-shale/) will drop one
piece of bitumen when mined with a pickaxe. More bitumen is dropped if a
[Fortune](https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Fortune) enchanted pickaxe is used.
