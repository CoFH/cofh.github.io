![Coal coke](/images/docs/1.12/thermal-foundation/coal-coke.png){:style="height: 128px"}


**Coal coke** is a material obtained by processing
[coal](https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Coal) in a [redstone
furnace](../../thermal-expansion/redstone-furnace/) with [pyrolytic
conversion](../../thermal-expansion/augment-pyrolytic-conversion/) installed. It can be used as
fuel, or as an ingredient to produce [steel](../steel-ingot/).

### Fuel
When used as fuel in a [furnace](https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Furnace), one
piece of coal coke lasts 160 seconds, which is enough to smelt up to 16 items.
It lasts twice as long as regular [coal](https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Coal).
