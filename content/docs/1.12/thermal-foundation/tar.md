![Tar](/images/docs/1.12/thermal-foundation/tar.png)


**Tar** is a byproduct of processing [oil sand](../oil-sand/) in a
[pulverizer](../../thermal-expansion/pulverizer/), and of processing [liquifacted
coal](../liquifacted-coal/) or [crude oil](../crude-oil/) in a
[fractionating still](../../thermal-expansion/fractionating-still/). It can be used to craft
[torches](https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Torches), and can replace
[slimeballs](https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Slimeball) in some recipes.
