**Resonant end stone** is a fairly common
[ore](https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Ore) that yields [resonant
clathrate](../resonant-clathrate/) ([resonant ender](../resonant-ender/)).
It can be found in the [End](https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/The_End).


Obtaining
---------

Resonant end stone occurs fairly commonly at any level of the End (layers
10-80). It occurs in large deposits, slightly larger than deposits of [coal
ore](https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Coal_Ore).

Resonant end stone must be mined with a [stone
pickaxe](https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Pickaxe) or better. It drops one piece
of [resonant clathrate](../resonant-clathrate/) when mined. More clathrate is
dropped if a [Fortune](https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Fortune) enchanted
pickaxe is used. The ore block itself can be obtained by mining it with a [Silk
Touch](https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Silk_Touch) enchanted pickaxe.

When resonant end stone is broken, some [resonant ender](../resonant-ender/)
comes flowing out, which can be dangerous when mining it. This fluid cannot be
picked up and eventually disappears. If a Silk Touch enchanted pickaxe is used,
no fluid comes flowing out.
