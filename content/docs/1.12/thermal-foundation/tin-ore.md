![Tin ore](/images/docs/1.12/thermal-foundation/ore-tin.png)


**Tin ore** is a common [ore](https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Ore) that yields
[tin](../tin-ingot/) and small amounts of
[iron](https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Iron_Ingot).


Obtaining
---------

Tin ore is about as common as [iron
ore](https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Iron_Ore), but it occurs at fewer levels
(layers 20-55). Veins of tin ore are also slightly smaller.

Tin ore must be mined with a [stone
pickaxe](https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Pickaxe) or better. If it is mined, it
drops itself as an item.

### Smashing
When tin ore is broken using a [Smashing](../../cofh-core/smashing/) enchanted
[pickaxe](https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Pickaxe) or similar tool, two piles of
[pulverized tin](../pulverized-tin/) are dropped instead
of the ore.


Trivia
------

* Tin ore is generated in the world using [CoFH World](../../cofh-world/) by
  default. The world generation can be tweaked or disabled using CoFH World's
  [configuration](../../cofh-world/world-generator-configuration/).
