**Grassoline** is a fluid obtained by processing
[biocrude](../biocrude/) in a [fractionating
still](../../thermal-expansion/fractionating-still/). It can be used as fuel in
a [compression dynamo](../../thermal-expansion/compression-dynamo/).

Usage
-----

Grassoline cannot be placed as a block.

### Compression Dynamo fuel
When used as fuel in a [compression
dynamo](../../thermal-expansion/compression-dynamo/), a bucket of grassoline
yields 800,000 RF, or 1,000,000 RF if an [agitative
manifold](../../thermal-expansion/augment-agitative-manifold/) is installed.


Trivia
------

* Grassoline is internally registered as "refined biofuel".
