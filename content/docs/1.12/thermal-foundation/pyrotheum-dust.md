**Pyrotheum dust** is the fire elemental dust. It is most commonly used to make
[blazing pyrotheum](../blazing-pyrotheum/). It can also be used to process
metal ores, and is used in several advanced crafting recipes.

Usage
-----

### Magma Crucible ingredient
{{<recipe_table type="crucible" ids_param="usage-recipes.crucible">}}

### Crafting ingredient
{{<recipe_table type="crafting-shaped" ids_param="usage-recipes.crafting-shaped">}}
{{<recipe_table type="crafting-shapeless" ids_param="usage-recipes.crafting-shapeless">}}

### Centrifugal Separator ingredient
{{<recipe_table type="centrifuge" ids_param="usage-recipes.centrifuge">}}

### Arcane Ensorcellator ingredient
Pyrotheum dust can be combined with
[books](https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Book) and [essence of
knowledge](../essence-of-knowledge/) in an [arcane
ensorcellator](../../thermal-expansion/arcane-ensorcellator/) to produce
[Smelting](../../cofh-core/smelting/) [enchanted
books](https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Enchanted_Book).

### Fuel
When used as fuel in a [furnace](https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Furnace), one
piece of pyrotheum dust lasts 1,200 seconds, which is enough to smelt up to 120
items. It lasts just as long as [blaze
rods](https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Blaze_Rod).

### Reactant Dynamo fuel
When used together with 100 mB of [gelid cryotheum](../gelid-cryotheum/) as
fuel in a [reactant dynamo](../../thermal-expansion/reactant-dynamo/), pyrotheum dust yields
400,000 RF per piece, or 500,000 RF if an [elemental
catalyzer](../../thermal-expansion/augment-elemental-catalyzer/) is installed.
