**Copper ore** is a common [ore](https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Ore) that
yields [copper](../copper-ingot/) and small amounts of
[gold](https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Gold_Ingot).


Obtaining
---------

Copper ore is slightly more common than [iron
ore](https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Iron_Ore), but it occurs at higher levels
(layers 40-96). Veins of copper ore are also slightly smaller. Below oceans,
copper ore less commonly occurs at deeper levels (layers 20-55).

Copper ore must be mined with a [stone
pickaxe](https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Pickaxe) or better. If it is mined, it
drops itself as an item.

### Crafting

### Pulverizer

### Induction Smelter

### Smashing
When copper ore is broken using a [Smashing](../../cofh-core/smashing/)
enchanted [pickaxe](https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Pickaxe) or similar tool,
two piles of [pulverized copper](../pulverized-copper/)
are dropped instead of the ore.


Trivia
------

* Copper ore is generated in the world using [CoFH World](../../cofh-world/) by
  default. The world generation can be tweaked or disabled using CoFH World's
  [configuration](../../cofh-world/world-generator-configuration/).
