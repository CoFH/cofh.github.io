**Resin** is a fluid obtained from spruce, birch, jungle and acacia
[trees](https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Tree). It can be processed into [tree
oil](../tree-oil/) and [rosin](../rosin/).


Obtaining
---------

### Arboreal Extractor
An [arboreal extractor](../../thermal-expansion/arboreal-extractor/) will produce resin when
placed next to a spruce, birch, jungle or acacia
[tree](https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Tree). Spruce trees produce twice as much
resin as other trees.

### Sawmill with Resin Funnel
A [sawmill](../../thermal-expansion/sawmill/) with a [resin funnel](../../thermal-expansion/augment-resin-funnel/)
installed produces resin as a byproduct when processing spruce, birch, jungle or
acacia [wood](https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Wood). Spruce wood yields twice as
much resin as other types of wood.
