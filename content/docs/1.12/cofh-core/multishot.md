**Multishot** is an [enchantment](https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Enchanting)
that makes [bows](https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Bow) shoot multiple arrows at
once, at the cost of only one arrow. Its maximum level is IV.


Usage
-----

[Bows](https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Bow), [reinforced
bows](../../thermal-foundation/reinforced-bows/) and [flux-infused
bows](../../redstone-arsenal/flux-infused-bow/) can all be enchanted with
Multishot. The amount of arrows a Multishot enchanted bow fires depends on the
enchantment level.

| Multishot level | Arrows fired |
|---
| I | 2 |
| II | 3 |
| III | 4 |
| IV | 5 |

Not all arrows fired in a single shot are fired quite as accurately as firing a
single arrow. However, all of them can damage the same
[entity](https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Entity) simultaneously.
