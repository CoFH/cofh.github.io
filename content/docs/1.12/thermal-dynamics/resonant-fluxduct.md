A **resonant fluxduct** is a [fluxduct](../fluxducts/) of the fifth tier. It
could be considered the highest 'regular' tier, due to the different behavior of
[cryo-stabilized fluxducts](../cryo-stabilized-fluxduct/).

Usage
-----

### Energy transfer
A resonant fluxduct works the same way as most other
[fluxducts](../fluxducts/). It transfers up to 25,000 RF/t per connection.
