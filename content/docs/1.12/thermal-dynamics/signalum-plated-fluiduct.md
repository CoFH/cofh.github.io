A **signalum-plated fluiduct** is a type of [fluiduct](../fluiduct/) that
transfers both fluids and [Redstone Flux](/docs/redstone-flux/).

Usage
-----

### Fluid and energy transfer
A signalum-plated fluiduct works the same way as a [hardened
fluiduct](../hardened-fluiduct/). However, it also transfers [Redstone
Flux](/docs/redstone-flux/) like a [fluxduct](../fluxducts/), at up to 4,000
RF/t per connection.
