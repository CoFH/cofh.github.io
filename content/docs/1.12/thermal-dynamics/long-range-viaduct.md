A **long range viaduct** is a type of [viaduct](../viaduct/) that provides
fast transport between two specific locations.

Usage
-----

### Placement
When placed, a long range viaduct connects to up to two adjacent long range
viaducts or [long range linking viaducts](../long-range-linking-viaduct/). It
does not connect to regular [viaducts](../viaduct/).

### Player transfer
Unlike regular [viaducts](../viaduct/), long range viaducts cannot be used as
entrances or destinations; players can only move through them while traveling
through a network of viaducts. They must be connected to regular viaducts using
[long range linking viaducts](../long-range-linking-viaduct/).

Players in a long range viaduct move at a speed of 20 blocks per second (1 block
per tick); twice as fast as they would in a regular viaduct.
