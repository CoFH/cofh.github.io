A **cryo-stabilized fluxduct** is a [fluxduct](../fluxducts/) of the sixth and
highest tier. It can transfer any amount of power up to 2,147,483,647 RF/t. It 
does not store any power internally.

### Fluid Transposer

Usage
-----

### Energy transfer
A cryo-stabilized fluxduct works mostly the same way as other
[fluxducts](../fluxducts/). However, it can transfer a practically unlimited amount of
[Redstone Flux](/docs/redstone-flux/) per tick. A network of cryo-stabilized
fluxducts also does not store any energy.
