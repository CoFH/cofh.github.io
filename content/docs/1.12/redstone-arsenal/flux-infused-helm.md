A **flux-infused helm** is a powerful
[helmet](https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Helmet) powered by [Redstone
Flux](/docs/redstone-flux/).


Obtaining
---------

### Crafting
{{<recipe_table type="crafting-shaped" ids_param="recipes.crafting-shaped">}}


Usage
-----

### Charging
A flux-infused helm can hold up to 800,000 [RF](/docs/redstone-flux/). It can be
charged using an [energetic infuser](../../thermal-expansion/energetic-infuser/), a [flux
capacitor](../../thermal-expansion/flux-capacitor/) or similar. It can also be charged by touching
a [fluxed electrum block](../fluxed-electrum-block/) or [flux crystal
block](../flux-crystal-block) while holding it. It can be charged at rates up
to 4,000 RF/t.

### Defense
A charged flux-infused helm offers the same protection as a [diamond
helmet](https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Diamond_Helmet). Instead of taking
damage, a flux-infused helm consumes 200 RF per damage point per hit.

When hit with flux damage (a special type of damage dealt by flux-infused
weapons), a flux-infused helm is charged with energy instead of consuming it.

### Enchantments
A flux-infused helm has an
[enchantability](https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Enchantability) of 20, which is
slightly lower than that of a [golden
helmet](https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Golden_Helmet). It can receive all the
enchantments that other helmets can receive.

When enchanted with [Unbreaking](https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Unbreaking), a
flux-infused helm has a chance to not consume [Redstone
Flux](/docs/redstone-flux/) when absorbing damage.

| Unbreaking level | No energy use chance |
|---|---|
| I | 40% |
| II | 50% |
| III | 57% |


A flux-infused helm can also be enchanted with [Holding](../../cofh-core/holding/) to
increase its energy capacity.

| Holding level | Capacity multiplier |
|---|---|
| I | × 1.5 |
| II | × 2 |
| III | × 2.5 |
| IV | × 3 |
