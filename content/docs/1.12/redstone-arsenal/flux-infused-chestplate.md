A **flux-infused chestplate** is a powerful
[chestplate](https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Chestplate) powered by [Redstone
Flux](/docs/redstone-flux/).


Obtaining
---------

### Crafting
{{<recipe_table type="crafting-shaped" ids_param="recipes.crafting-shaped">}}


Usage
-----

### Charging
A flux-infused chestplate can hold up to 800,000 [RF](/docs/redstone-flux/).
It can be charged using an [energetic
infuser](../../thermal-expansion/energetic-infuser/), a [flux
capacitor](../../thermal-expansion/flux-capacitor/) or similar. It can also be
charged by touching a [fluxed electrum block](../fluxed-electrum-block/) or
[flux crystal block](../flux-crystal-block) while holding it. It can be charged
at rates up to 4,000 RF/t.

### Defense
A charged flux-infused chestplate offers the same protection as a [diamond
chestplate](https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Diamond_Chestplate). Instead of
taking damage, a flux-infused chestplate consumes 200 RF per damage point per
hit.

When hit with flux damage (a special type of damage dealt by flux-infused
weapons), a flux-infused chestplate is charged with energy instead of consuming
it.

### Enchantments
A flux-infused chestplate has an
[enchantability](https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Enchantability) of 20, which is
slightly lower than that of a [golden
chestplate](https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Golden_Chestplate). It can receive
all the enchantments that other chestplates can receive.

When enchanted with [Unbreaking](https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Unbreaking), a
flux-infused chestplate has a chance to not consume [Redstone
Flux](/docs/redstone-flux/) when absorbing damage.

| Unbreaking level | No energy use chance |
|---|---|
| I | 40% |
| II | 50% |
| III | 57% |


A flux-infused chestplate can also be enchanted with
[Holding](../../cofh-core/holding/) to increase its energy capacity.

| Holding level | Capacity multiplier |
|---|---|
| I | × 1.5 |
| II | × 2 |
| III | × 2.5 |
| IV | × 3 |
