**CoFH World** is a mod for Minecraft 1.12 that provides common world generation
functionality for the mods of Team CoFH for that version of the game. It also
provides a configuration system that allows users to define new types of
features to generate in worlds.

[Thermal Foundation](../../thermal-foundation/) uses this mod for its world
generation by default.
