**`boulder`** is one of the [feature types](../) provided by [CoFH
World](../../../). It generates groups of boulders, which are nearly spherical
deposits of blocks, like the [moss stone
boulders](https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Generated_structures#Moss_stone_boulder)
that are generated by default.

Boulders are only generated on the surface or underground. They are never
generated in midair.

The value `material` of a [feature type
configuration](../../feature-format/#feature-type-configuration) is only used to
determine the position of boulders. When generating the boulders themselves, any
block may be replaced.


Options
-------

When using this feature type, the following values must be added to the [feature
type configuration](../../feature-format/#feature-type-configuration).

|Name|Type|Default|Description|
|--- |--- |--- |--- |
|`block`|[Block ID](../../common-formats/block-id/) / array of block IDs|-|The type(s) of block that boulders consist of. When specified as an array, a block type is selected randomly for each generated block.|
|`diameter`|Number|-|The minimum radius of a boulder, in blocks.|
|`size-variance` (optional)|Number|`2`|The maximum amount of blocks that may be randomly added to the minimum radius of a boulder.|
|`count` (optional)|Number|`3`|The amount of boulders that a group of boulders may consist of.|
|`count-variance` (optional)|Number|`0`|The maximum amount that may be randomly added to the number of boulders in a group.|
|`hollow` (optional)|Boolean|`false`|If `true`, boulders are hollowed out with air blocks on the inside.|
|`hollow-size` (optional)|Number|`0.1665`|The size of the hollow part of a hollow boulder. Some experimenting will be needed for the desired result. Note that higher values will make the hollow part larger than the boulder itself.|
|`hollow-variance` (optional)|Number|`0`|How much the size of the hollow part of hollow boulders may differ per boulder. May be any value between `0` and `1`. Applied to `hollow-size` as follows: `[hollow-size] * (1 - [random 0.0-1.0] * [hollow-variance])`.|
