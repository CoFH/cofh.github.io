**`lake`** is one of the [feature types](../) provided by [CoFH
World](../../../). It generates
[lakes](https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Generated_structures#Lake), like the
small ponds of [water](https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Water) and
[lava](https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Lava) that are generated by default.

Lakes are only generated on the surface or underground. They are never generated
in midair.
