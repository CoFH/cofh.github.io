**`lake`** is one of the [feature types](../) provided by [CoFH
World](../../../). It generates
[lakes](https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Generated_structures#Lake), like the
small ponds of [water](https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Water) and
[lava](https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Lava) that are generated by default.

Lakes are only generated on the surface or underground. They are never generated
in midair.


Options
-------

When using this feature type, the following values must be added to the [feature
type configuration](../../feature-format/#feature-type-configuration).


|Name|Type|Default|Description|
|--- |--- |--- |--- |
|`block`|[Block ID](../../common-formats/block-id/) / array of block IDs|-|The block(s) used to generate the 'liquid' part of lakes. Note that this doesn't strictly have to be a liquid block. When specified as an array, a block type is selected randomly for each generated block.|
|`use-material` (optional)|Boolean|`false`|When `false`, any block may be replaced to generate lakes, ignoring the `material` option in the feature type configuration.|
|`outline-block` (optional)|[Block ID](../../common-formats/block-id/) / array of block IDs|(None)|The block(s) to surround lakes with, like [stone](https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Stone) around [lava](https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Lava) lakes. By default, about half of the blocks in the outline are actually generated, and the outline only replaces existing blocks in the world. When specified as an array, a block type is selected randomly for each generated block.|
|`solid-outline` (optional)|Boolean|`false`|If `true`, every block in the outline of a lake is generated, instead of only about half of them.|
|`total-outline` (optional)|Boolean|`false`|If `true`, the outline of a lake completely surrounds it, even where it doesn't replace existing blocks in the world.|
|`gap-block` (optional)|[Block ID](../../common-formats/block-id/) / array of block IDs|Air|The block(s) to place above lakes to carve out space. When specified as an array, a block type is selected randomly for each generated block.|
