title: 'Augment: Reflux Column'
---

A **reflux column** is an [augment](../augments/) that increases the
conversion efficiency of a [fractionating still](../fractionating-still/)
that processes fossil fuels.


Obtaining
---------

### Crafting
{{<recipe_table type="crafting-shaped" ids_param="recipes.crafting-shaped">}}


Usage
-----

### Installation
A reflux column can be installed in the Augmentation tab in a [fractionating
still](../fractionating-still/)'s GUI. It is a specialization that cannot be
installed together with other specialization augments.

### Effects
A [fractionating still](../fractionating-still/) with a reflux column
installed produces an additional 50 mB of the produced fluid per operation.
However, the machine can only process fossil fuels ([liquifacted
coal](../../thermal-foundation/liquifacted-coal/), [crude oil](../../thermal-foundation/crude-oil/) and
[naphtha](../../thermal-foundation/naphtha/)), and the amount of energy required per operation is
increased by 100%.
