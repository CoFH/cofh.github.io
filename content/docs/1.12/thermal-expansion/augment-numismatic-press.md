A **numismatic press** is an [augment](../augments/) that allows for a
[compactor](../compactor/) to produce metal coins instead of plates.

Usage
-----

### Installation
A numismatic press can be installed in the Augmentation tab in a
[compactor](../compactor/)'s GUI. It is a specialization that cannot be
installed together with other specialization augments.

### Effects
An installed numismatic press allows for a [compactor](../compactor/) to
produce metal coins from ingots. This replaces the machine's ability to produce
metal plates.
