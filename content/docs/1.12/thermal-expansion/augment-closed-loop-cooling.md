title: 'Augment: Closed-Loop Cooling'
---

A **closed-loop cooling** [augment](../augments/) allows for a [compression
dynamo](../compression-dynamo/) to work without consuming the
[coolant](../coolants/) it holds.


Obtaining
---------

### Crafting
{{<recipe_table type="crafting-shaped" ids_param="recipes.crafting-shaped">}}


Usage
-----

### Installation
A closed-loop cooling augment can be installed in the Augmentation tab in a
[compression dynamo](../compression-dynamo/)'s GUI. It is a specialization
that cannot be installed together with other specialization augments.

### Effects
A [compression dynamo](../compression-dynamo/) with closed-loop cooling
installed does not consume any [coolant](../coolants/) when active. However,
at least some coolant must be present in the dynamo for it to work.
