title: 'Augment: Auxiliary Reception Coil'
---

An **auxiliary reception coil** is an [augment](../augments/) that increases
the maximum power usage of a [machine](../machines/), thereby increasing its
processing speed.

{{<recipe_table type="crafting-shaped" ids_param="recipes.crafting-shaped">}}


Usage
-----

### Installation
An auxiliary reception coil can be installed in the Augmentation tab in a
[machine](../machines/)'s GUI. It can be installed multiple times, stacking
its effects.

### Effects
Installed auxiliary reception coils increase a [machine](../machines/)'s
maximum power usage, thereby increasing its processing speed. However, they also
increase the amount of energy required per operation.

| Installed amount | Max. power usage multiplier | Energy increase |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | × 2 | + 10% |
| 2 | × 3 | + 20% |
| 3 | × 4 | + 30% |
| 4 | × 5 | + 40% |
| 5 | × 6 | + 50% |
| 6 | × 7 | + 60% |
| 7 | × 8 | + 70% |
| 8 | × 9 | + 80% |
| 9 | × 10 | + 90% |


If auxiliary reception coils are installed together with other augments that
increase the amount of energy required per operation, their energy increase
percentages are added together before being applied to the amount of energy.
