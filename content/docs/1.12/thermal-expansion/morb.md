Usage
-----

### Capturing mobs
When a morb is thrown at a [mob](https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Mob), the mob
is captured and stored inside the morb.

### Releasing mobs
A filled morb can be thrown to release the contained
[mob](https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Mob). The morb has a 75% chance of
breaking after releasing the mob.

### Centrifugal Separator with Enstabulation Apparatus
A [centrifugal separator](../centrifugal-separator/) with
an [enstabulation
apparatus](../augment-enstabulation-apparatus/) installed
processes filled morbs into [mob](https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Mob) drops and
[essence of knowledge](../../thermal-foundation/essence-of-knowledge/). When
processing morbs, there is a 25% chance that an empty morb is returned as an
output.

### Creature Encaptulator
A [creature encaptulator](../creature-encaptulator/) uses morbs to
automatically capture [mobs](https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Mob) in an area.
