An **alchemical retort** is an [augment](../augments/) that allows for a
[fractionating still](../fractionating-still/) to refine [fluid
potions](../../thermal-foundation/potion-fluid/), increasing their potency to levels that cannot be
obtained through [brewing](https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Brewing).

Usage
-----

### Installation
An alchemical retort can be installed in the Augmentation tab in a
[fractionating still](../fractionating-still/)'s GUI. It is a specialization
that cannot be installed together with other specialization augments.

### Effects
A [fractionating still](../fractionating-still/) with an alchemical retort
installed can refine level II [fluid potions](../../thermal-foundation/potion-fluid/) to increase
their potency to [levels up to IV](../../cofh-core/potions/#stronger-potions).
It can also refine the extended versions of potions (brewed using
[redstone](https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Redstone)) to increase their potency
to [levels up to III](../../cofh-core/potions/#stronger-potions). However, the
machine cannot process anything other than potions.

Refining a fluid potion requires 2,500 RF per operation. The amount of fluid
consumed and produced per operation differs depending on the potency level of
the potion that is being refined.

| Level increase | Input amount | Output amount |
|---|---|---|
| II to III | 250 mB | 200 mB |
| III to IV | 200 mB | 150 mB |
| I to II (extended) | 250 mB | 200 mB |
| II to III (extended) | 200 mB | 150 mB |
