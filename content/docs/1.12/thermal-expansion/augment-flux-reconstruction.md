title: 'Augment: Flux Reconstruction'
---

A **flux reconstruction** [augment](../augments/) allows for an [energetic
infuser](../energetic-infuser/) to repair damaged items using [essence of
knowledge](../../thermal-foundation/essence-of-knowledge/).


Obtaining
---------

### Crafting
{{<recipe_table type="crafting-shaped" ids_param="recipes.crafting-shaped">}}


Usage
-----

### Installation
A flux reconstruction augment can be installed in the Augmentation tab in an
[energetic infuser](../energetic-infuser/)'s GUI. It is a specialization that
cannot be installed together with other specialization augments.

### Effects
An [energetic infuser](../energetic-infuser/) with flux reconstruction
installed repairs damaged items instead of charging items with [Redstone
Flux](/docs/redstone-flux/). It uses 500 RF and 5 mB of [essence of
knowledge](../../thermal-foundation/essence-of-knowledge/) per restored durability point.
