**Potion fluid** is a fluid added by [CoFH Core](../../cofh-core). It is the
fluid form of Minecraft potions. 

Obtaining
---------

### Alchemical Imbuer
Can be obtained directly by [brewing](https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki/Brewing)
potions in the [Alchemical Imbuer](../../thermal-expansion/alchemical-imbuer).

### Storing
Using a [potion bottle](https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki/Potion) on a machine,
device, or storage block that accepts potion fluids will fill the block with
250 mB of potion fluid and return an empty bottle.

Conversely, using an empty bottle on a block containing potion fluid will fill
the bottle and remove 250mB of potion fluid from the block. 

Usage
-----

Potion fluid does not have a bucket form and cannot be placed as a block.
