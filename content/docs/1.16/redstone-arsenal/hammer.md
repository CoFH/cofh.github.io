**Unempowered**


**Empowered**
Mining speed greatly reduced. Damage and attack speed increased. Hitting a mob grants the user 2s of speed. Using it on the ground creates a shockwave, which knocks affected mobs back, inflicts the sundered debuff on affected mobs, and grants the user a 2.5s strength buff. Hitting a mob while this buff is active will extend its duration by 0.5s.
