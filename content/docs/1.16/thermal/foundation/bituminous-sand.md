---------

Bituminous sand appears between Y levels 40 and 60 in [deserts](https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki/Desert) & [badlands](https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki/Badlands).


Usage
-----

Bituminous sand can be directly used in a [furnace](https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki/Furnace), [blast furnace](https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki/Blast_Furnace), or [stirling dynamo](../../expansion/stirling-dynamo) as fuel. It smelts 12 items in an ordinary furnace. 

More energy can be produced from bituminous sand by further processing it into more refined solid and liquid fuels.
