Slag is a product of [induction smelting](../../expansion/induction-smelter/) gravel. Coming from plain gravel, it does not contain any special compounds that would make it [rich](../rich-slag/).

Obtaining
---------
Smelting gravel in the induction smelter produces slag as a secondary product. Slag can also be obtained from [pulverizing](../../expansion/pulverizer/) [basalz shards](../basalz-shard/).
