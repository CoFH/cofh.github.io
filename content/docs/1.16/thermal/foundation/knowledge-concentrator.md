The **knowledge concentrator** [augment](../../augments) allows certain blocks, such as the [redstone furnace](../../expansion/redstone-furnace), to automatically collect experience from recipes or the world. It starts with a max storage of 2.5k XP, which is affected by scale factor from [integral components](../integral-components). Once installed, a small icon resembling an [Insightful Crystal](../../innovation/insightful-crystal) will appear in the lower right corner of the block's GUI. The XP stored in the machine can be retrieved by clicking on this icon.
