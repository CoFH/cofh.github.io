A **blitz mote** is a lump containing the fierce essence of lightning recovered from a [blitz](../blitz).

Obtaining
---------

A [blitz](../blitz) has a 50% chance of dropping a blitz mote when killed by a player. This can be improved by using a weapon enchanted with [looting](https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki/Looting); each level of looting results in an additional 50% roll for a blitz mote.


Usage
-----

Blitz motes themselves are not used for anything besides being ground into powder. Blitz powder can be used for explosives and charges.
