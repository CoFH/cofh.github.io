Usage
-----

When right clicked on a block, an ice charge will be consumed to freeze that block. Campfires/fires will be extinguished and water/lava/air blocks adjacent to the clicked block face will be converted into ice/obsidian/snow, respectively.

Activating a dispenser with an ice charge in it will fire a linear projectile that applies the [Chilled](../../../cofh-core/status-effects) effect to mobs hit.

Ice charges may be used in the crafting bench to freeze liquids.
