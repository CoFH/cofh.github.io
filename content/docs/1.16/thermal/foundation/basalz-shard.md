A **basalz shard** is a fragment containing the raw essence of earth appropriated from a [basalz](../basalz).

Obtaining
---------

A [basalz](../basalz) has a 50% chance of dropping a basalz shard when killed by a player. This can be improved by using a weapon enchanted with [looting](https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki/Looting); each level of looting results in an additional 50% roll for a basalz shard.

Usage
-----

Basalz shards themselves are not used for anything besides being ground into powder. Basalz powder can be used as a [catalyst](../../catalysts), or to craft explosives and charges.
