Usage
-----

With the lock in hand, right click on a block to install it. There will be a "click" sound and one lock will be consumed if the installation was successful. If the block already has a lock installed or is otherwise incompatible, no sound will be played and the lock will not be consumed.

Alternatively, the lock may be held in the off-hand. Any lockable blocks in the main hand will be automatically locked once they are placed.

Blocks with a lock installed will have a "Security" tab on the left side of the block's GUI. Opening this tab allows the owner (the player who installed the lock) to change the security settings of the block. There are 4 modes:
- Public Access: all players may access the contents and configuration of the block through the GUI.
- Owner Only: only the owner may access the contents/configuration.
- Friends Only: only the owner and owner's [friends](../../../cofh-core/friend-list) may access the contents/configuration.
- Team Only: only the owner and owner's [team members](https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki/Commands/team) may access the contents/configuration.
