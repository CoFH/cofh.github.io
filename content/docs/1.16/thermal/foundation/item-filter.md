Usage
-----

The filter can be configured in a separate GUI, accessible by shift-right-clicking the block or item it is installed in, or through a tab in the block's GUI. The original block GUI can be returned to by clicking the same tab again. The filter can accept up to 15 items, with buttons to change between allow/deny list and to match/ignore NBT.

Note: taking the augment out of a machine or item and putting it back in will erase the contents of the filter!


Compatibility
-----

The item filter augment is compatible with the following blocks/items. Certain blocks, such as the [magmatic dynamo](../../expansion/magmatic-dynamo), accept the filter but cannot actually make use of it.
