Usage
-----

When right clicked on earth-type blocks, such as stone and dirt, an earth charge will be consumed to instantly mine said block.

Activating a dispenser with an earth charge in it will fire a linear projectile that applies the [Sundered](../../../cofh-core/status-effects) effect to mobs hit and greatly knocks them back.

Earth charges may be used in the crafting bench to grind various metals and minerals into their dust forms and break certain storage blocks down, such as a [quartz block](https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki/Block_of_Quartz) into four [quartz](https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki/Nether_Quartz).
