**Syrup** is a thick, delicious fluid that makes any flapjack misadventures worthwhile. It is produced from **sap**, a sugary fluid collected from certain trees.

Obtaining
---------

Sap is collected from [dark oak trees](https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki/Dark_oak) with the [arboreal extractor](../../arboreal-extractor). Syrup is produced by concentrating [sap](../sap).
