**Integral components** are important [augments](../../augments) that improve the overall functionality of any augmentable block or item. More specifically, they apply a *scale factor* modifier, which can improve RF storage/transfer, fluid storage/transfer, RF/t usage/generation, mining speed/level, attack damage, etc. Increases to these stats through scale factor will stack with increases from other modifiers. However, scale factor does not stack with itself, so putting multiple integral components in the same block/item will not provide any benefit. For more information on how augments stack, visit the [augments](../../augments) page.


Obtaining
---------

Integral components can be obtained through crafting.

Usage
-----

Different integral components have different scale factor modifiers.

|Component Level|Scale Factor|
|---|---|
|Hardened|2x|
|Reinforced|3x|
|Resonant|4x|


Compatibility
-----
Integral components are compatible with all augmentable blocks and items.
