**Rubber** is a stretchy, waterproof material made from **latex**. It must be cured before it can be used to craft other things.

Obtaining
---------

Latex is collected from [jungle trees](https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki/Jungle_tree) with the [arboreal extractor](../../arboreal-extractor) or squeezed from [vines](https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki/Vines) and [dandelions](https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki/Flower) with the [multiservo press](../../expansion/multiservo-press).

Rubber is the product of congealing latex, either by crafting vines and dandelions with water or by just crafting latex.

Curing

Rubber can be vulcanized in a [furnace](https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki/Furnace) or with [sulfur](../sulfur) in an [induction smelter](../../expansion/induction-smelter) in order to improve its resiliance and elasticity.
