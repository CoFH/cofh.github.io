Usage
-----

The hammer can be used to rotate [machines](../../expansion/machines), [dynamos](../../expansion/dynamos), [devices](../../devices), etc. by right-clicking on them. It can also be used to dismantle these blocks by shift-right-clicking on them. Lastly, holding the hammer and pressing the cycle mode (V) key will toggle "Engineer Vision." This highlights the effective range of certain blocks (such as the [vacuumulator](../../expansion/vacuumulator)) with brightly-colored lines.

The hammer can also be used to craft the [Thermalpedia](../thermalpedia). It does not get consumed.
