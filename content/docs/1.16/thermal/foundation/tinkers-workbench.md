Usage
-----

The tinker's workbench has two modes which you can toggle between using the button below the item slot in the GUI: charge/refill and augment. In charge/refill mode, the item in the slot will be refilled with the fluid in the tinker bench and charged. In augment mode, the item stops getting charged/refilled and the 4 augment slots in the center become accessible, allowing the user to add/remove/swap augments. The effect of add/remove/swapping augments only applies when you switch back to charge/refill mode or take the item out.
