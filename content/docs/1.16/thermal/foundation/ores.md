[Thermal Foundation](../) adds new ores to the world.

Obtaining
---------

Ores spawn at different Y-levels and sometimes different biomes.

|Ore|Y Level|
|---|---|
|Copper|40-100|
|Lead|0-32|
|Nickel|0-128|
|Silver|0-32|
|Tin|20-60|
|Apatite|Any\*|
|Cinnabar|Any|
|Niter|Any||
|Sulfur|Any||

\*Apatite only spawns when [Thermal Cultivation](../../cultivation) is installed.


Usage
-----

Ores can be directly smelted into their respective resources. Alternatively, they can be [pulverized](../../expansion/pulverizer/) or [induction smelted](../../expansion/induction-smelter/) for higher yield.
