Usage
-----

When right clicked on a block, a lightning charge will be consumed to call down a single bolt of lightning at that location.

Activating a dispenser with a lightning charge in it will fire a linear projectile that applies the [Shocked](../../../cofh-core/status-effects) effect to mobs hit.
