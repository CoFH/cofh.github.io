**Sulfur** is a reactive mineral used to cure rubber and make gunpowder.

Obtaining
---------
Sulfur is typically obtained from [sulfur ore](../ores). Sulfur may also be obtained as a byproduct from refining [light oil](../light-oil) and processing [coal ore](https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki/Coal_Ore), [lapis lazuli ore](https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki/Lapis_Lazuli_Ore), and [blaze rods](https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki/Blaze_Rod).

Forms
---------
Like other minerals, sulfur can be ground into dust. At the moment, there is no real benefit to doing so. It can also be crafted into blocks for decoration or storage.
