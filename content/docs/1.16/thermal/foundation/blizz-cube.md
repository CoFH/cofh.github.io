A **blizz cube** is a chunk containing the pure essence of ice procured from a [blizz](../blizz).

Obtaining
---------

A [blizz](../blizz) has a 50% chance of dropping a blizz cube when killed by a player. This can be improved by using a weapon enchanted with [looting](https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki/Looting); each level of looting results in an additional 50% roll for a blizz cube.

Usage
-----

Blizz cubes themselves are not used for anything besides being ground into powder. Blizz powder can be used to craft explosives and charges.
