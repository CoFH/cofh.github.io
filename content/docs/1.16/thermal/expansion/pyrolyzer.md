> I fear no man. But that thing... it scares me.

A **pyrolyzer** is a [machine](../machines/) that purifies fuels into higher
quality fuels.

Obtaining
---------

A placed pyrolyzer can be instantly picked up by dismantling it with a
[crescent hammer](../../thermal-foundation/crescent-hammer/). It can also be
mined using a [pickaxe](https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki/Pickaxe) or by hand,
though this can be much slower.

When mined, its configuration, power, and augments are preserved in the item
form. Any items inside will drop, and any fluids will be voided. This behaviour
can be changed in the [configs](../../faq#configs).

Usage
-----

### Placement
When placed, a pyrolyzer faces the player. It can face any of the four cardinal
directions, and can be rotated using a
[crescent hammer](../../thermal-foundation/crescent-hammer/).

### Processing
A pyrolyzer has one input slot, four output slots, and one output tank.

When a pyrolyzer's input slot is filled with an item, the machine will start
consuming [Redstone Flux](/docs/redstone-flux/) to process it. Every processed
item requires a certain amount of energy. When enough energy has been consumed
for an item, the input is consumed and the output is placed in the output tank.
Secondary items may also be produced, which are placed in the output slots.

An unaugmented pyrolyzer processes items at a fixed 20 RF/t. If its internal RF
buffer runs out before the process is complete, the pyrolyzer stops and the
progress bar resets.

The processing speed of the pyrolyzer can be increased by installing
[integral components](#augmentation) and certain [augments](#augmentation).

### Input and output
Fluids and items can enter and exit a pyrolyzer through any of its sides. Every
side of of a pyrolyzer may be configured to input items and fluids, output items
and fluids, or input and output at the same time. This is described in more
detail [here](../../thermal-expansion/machines#configuration).

A pyrolyzer can automatically transfer up to 1,000 mB of fluid and up to 64
items at a time.

### Augmentation
A pyrolyzer can have augments installed to improve certain properties. It can
have a max of 4 augments installed.

Augments can be installed in the **Augmentation** tab in the pyrolyzerâ€™s GUI.
