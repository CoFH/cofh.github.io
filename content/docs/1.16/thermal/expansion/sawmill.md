A **sawmill** is a [machine](../machines/) that processes
[wood](https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki/Wood) into
[planks](https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki/Planks) more efficiently than by hand.

Obtaining
---------

A placed sawmill can be instantly picked up by dismantling it with a
[crescent hammer](../../thermal-foundation/crescent-hammer/). It can also be
mined using a [pickaxe](https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki/Pickaxe) or by hand,
though this can be much slower.

When mined, its configuration, power, and augments are preserved in the item
form. Any items inside will drop, and any fluids will be voided. This behaviour
can be changed in the [configs](../../faq#configs).

Usage
-----

### Placement
When placed, a sawmill faces the player. It can face any of the four cardinal
directions, and can be rotated using a
[crescent hammer](../../thermal-foundation/crescent-hammer/).

### Processing
A sawmill has one input slot and four output slots.

When a sawmill's input slot is filled with an item, the machine will start
consuming [Redstone Flux](/docs/redstone-flux/) to process it. Every processed
item requires a certain amount of energy. When enough energy has been consumed
for an item, the input is consumed and the output is placed in the output slots.

An unaugmented sawmill processes items at a fixed 20 RF/t. If its internal RF
buffer runs out before the process is complete, the sawmill stops and the
progress bar resets.

The processing speed of the sawmill can be increased by installing
[integral components](#augmentation) and certain [augments](#augmentation).

### Input and output
Fluids and items can enter and exit a sawmill through any of its sides. Every
side of of a sawmill may be configured to input items and fluids, output items
and fluids, or input and output at the same time. This is described in more
detail [here](../../thermal-expansion/machines#configuration).

A sawmill can automatically transfer up to 1,000 mB of fluid and up to 64 items
at a time.

### Augmentation
A sawmill can have augments installed to improve certain properties. It can have
a max of 4 augments installed.

Augments can be installed in the **Augmentation** tab in the sawmillâ€™s GUI.
