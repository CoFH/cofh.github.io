An **induction smelter**, or **smelter** for short, is a [machine](../machines/)
that smelts items together at high temperatures. Despite the name, the machine
cannot be used for [smelting](https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki/Smelting).

Obtaining
---------

A placed induction smelter can be instantly picked up by dismantling it with a
[crescent hammer](../../thermal-foundation/crescent-hammer/). It can also be
mined using a [pickaxe](https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki/Pickaxe) or by hand,
though this can be much slower.

When mined, its configuration, power, and augments are preserved in the item
form. Any items inside will drop, and any fluids will be voided. This behaviour
can be changed in the [configs](../../faq#configs).

Usage
-----

### Placement
When placed, an induction smelter faces the player. It can face any of the four
cardinal directions, and can be rotated using a
[crescent hammer](../../thermal-foundation/crescent-hammer/).

### Processing
An induction smelter has four input slots (one of which is for a
[catalyst](../../thermal-expansion/catalysts#induction-smelter)), and four
output slots.

When an induction smelter's input slot is filled with an item, the machine will
start consuming [Redstone Flux](/docs/redstone-flux/) to smelt it.
Every smelted item requires a certain amount of energy. When enough energy has
been consumed for an item, the input is consumed and the output is placed in the
output slot. Secondary items may also be produced, which are
placed in the output slots.
[Catalysts](../../thermal-expansion/catalysts#induction-smelter) may be added
to change the number of items produced and the energy consumed.

An unaugmented induction smelter smelts items at a fixed 20 RF/t. If its
internal RF buffer runs out before the process is complete, the smelter stops
and the progress bar resets.

The processing speed of the induction smelter can be increased by installing
[integral components](#augmentation) and certain [augments](#augmentation).

### Input and output
Fluids and items can enter and exit an induction smelter through any of its
sides. Every side of of a smelter may be configured to input items and fluids,
output items and fluids, or input and output at the same time. This is described
in more detail [here](../../thermal-expansion/machines#configuration).

An induction smelter can automatically transfer up to 64 items at a time.

### Augmentation
An induction smelter can have augments installed to improve certain properties.
It can have a max of 4 augments installed.

Augments can be installed in the **Augmentation** tab in the induction
smelterâ€™s GUI.
