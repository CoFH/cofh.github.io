Here, you'll find all the information you need for all of Thermal Series mods! This section will also include some general changes that you may not expect, and some showcases of it all!

**General FAQ**

**The fluids are not place-able! What is going on there?** Due to the 1.13 rewrite of minecraft/forge/and then the eventual 1.15 thermal rewrite. The fluids just are not plausable currently in forge. So in 1.16 these will stay unable to be placed.

**Where did the cool tools like hammers, scythe, swords, shields, and what not from Thermal Expansion go?** They have moved to [Tools' Complement!](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/tools-complement) They were bloat being in Thermal Expansion but fair enough to be in their own mod! Do note that you don't need Thermal Foundation to use them. If you have another mod that adds a material such as silver than the armor will appear!

**I can't find the config, where is it?** The Configs now have two places! All client-side configs are in your normal config folder. The server configs are located in your worlds config folder! These can be applied to all new worlds by moving them to the defaultconfigs folder!
