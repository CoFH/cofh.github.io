Usage

Phyto-soil is dirt infused with phyto-gro. It approximately doubles the growth rate of plants grown on it, which can be further improved to ~5x using a [Phyto-soil infuser](../../cultivation/phyto-soil-infuser).
Just like normal soil, it must be tilled for crops to grow on it.
Unlike normal farmland, tilled phyto-soil cannot be trampled and does not need water nearby to remain hydrated.
