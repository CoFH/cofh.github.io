title: Vanilla+ Tools and Satchels
---

Two new CoFH mods have just been released: [Vanilla+
Tools](https://minecraft.curseforge.com/projects/cofh-vanilla-tools) and
[Vanilla+
Satchels](https://minecraft.curseforge.com/projects/cofh-vanilla-satchels). They
are part of the new "Vanilla+" series, a group of lightweight mods intended for use
in lightly modded or low-technology modpacks. Both mods require [CoFH
Core](/docs/1.12/cofh-core/) to run.

Documentation for the mods will be added to the website soon. For now, here's a
quick overview:

### Vanilla+ Tools

Vanilla+ Tools adds additional tools and weapons made of wood, stone, iron, gold and
diamond. They are the same types of additional tools and weapons that [Thermal
Foundation](/docs/1.12/thermal-foundation/) provides:
[hammers](/docs/1.12/vanillaplus-tools/hammers/),
[sickles](/docs/1.12/vanillaplus-tools/sickles/), [fishing
rods](/docs/1.12/vanillaplus-tools/fishing-rods/),
[shears](/docs/1.12/vanillaplus-tools/shears/), [reinforced
bows](/docs/1.12/vanillaplus-tools/reinforced-bows/) and
[shields](/docs/1.12/vanillaplus-tools/shields/).

### Vanilla+ Satchels

Vanilla+ Satchels adds a set of [satchels](/docs/1.12/vanillaplus-satchels/satchel/),
which are items that store other items, and are able to automatically store
picked up items. They are functionally identical to the
[satchels](/docs/1.12/thermal-expansion/satchel/) added by [Thermal
Expansion](/docs/1.12/thermal-expansion/), but are made of leather, iron, gold,
diamond and emerald.
