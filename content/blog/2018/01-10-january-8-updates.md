title: January 8 updates
---

On January 8, new updates were released for [CoFH Core](/docs/1.12/cofh-core/), the
[Thermal Series](/docs/#thermal-series) and [Redstone
Arsenal](/docs/1.12/redstone-arsenal/).

#### General
* Various refactors and bugfixes (see the [issue
  tracker](https://github.com/CoFH/Feedback/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aclosed+label%3Afixed+sort%3Aupdated-desc)).

#### Thermal Foundation
* [Tomes of knowledge](/docs/1.12/thermal-foundation/tome-of-knowledge/) can be filled with [Industrial
  Foregoing](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/industrial-foregoing)'s
  essence, converting it into experience.

#### Thermal Expansion
* [Sequential Fabricator](/docs/1.12/thermal-expansion/sequential-fabricator/)
  * A machine that crafts items.
  * Augments:
    * [Pattern Validation](/docs/1.12/thermal-expansion/augment-pattern-validation/) allows for
      more intelligent input. Two input slots are designated for each crafting
      slot.
    * [Fluidic Fabrication](/docs/1.12/thermal-expansion/augment-fluidic-fabrication/) adds a fluid
      tank, which can replace filled buckets in recipes.
* [Enstabulation Apparatus](/docs/1.12/thermal-expansion/augment-enstabulation-apparatus/)
  * An augment that allows for a [centrifugal
    separator](/docs/1.12/thermal-expansion/centrifugal-separator/) to "process" filled
    [morbs](/docs/1.12/thermal-expansion/morb/).
  * Morbs will provide items and [essence of
    knowledge](/docs/1.12/thermal-foundation/essence-of-knowledge/) from the contained mobs.
* The crafting recipes of [machines](/docs/1.12/thermal-expansion/machines/),
  [devices](/docs/1.12/thermal-expansion/devices/), [dynamos](/docs/1.12/thermal-expansion/dynamos/) and
  [augments](/docs/1.12/thermal-expansion/augments/) have been tweaked.
  * Dynamos and augments are all slightly cheaper.
  * Augments are slightly simpler to craft.
* [Compactors](/docs/1.12/thermal-expansion/compactor/) can press elemental (blaze, blizz, etc.)
  powders into rods.
* All fluid-handling blocks can now be properly filled and drained by hand using
  buckets or [reservoirs](/docs/1.12/thermal-expansion/reservoir/).
