title: Open Beta is upon us!
---

Alright, so here's the deal with the Open Beta.

It is a BETA. Things might not work quite right. There might be bugs. There are
a couple of minor graphical things. The Lexicon isn't implemented. We know.

Recipes might change. Machines might change. Anything *might* still change.

The takeaway? Download this and understand that something could possibly go
wrong. If you aren't comfortable with that, wait another week or two.

For those of you brave people, and those of you who get stuck with the mod due
to your bleeding-edge admins, please use the github repos at
[https://github.com/cofh](https://github.com/cofh) to report your bugs!

We're going to continue working on it, but I'm fairly swamped through the middle
of next month. Ducts will be coming. For now, I know that it might be a little
awkward, but there are so many mods using RF now that I think it'll work out.
