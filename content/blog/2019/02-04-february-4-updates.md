title: February 4 updates
---

On February 4, new updates were released for [CoFH Core](/docs/1.12/cofh-core/), the
[Thermal Series](/docs/#thermal-series) and [Redstone
Arsenal](/docs/1.12/redstone-arsenal/). These are minor updates with bugfixes and QoL
improvements.

#### General
* Various tweaks and bugfixes (see the [issue
  tracker](https://github.com/CoFH/Feedback/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aclosed+label%3Afixed+sort%3Aupdated-desc)).

#### CoFH Core
* Blocks such as machines and devices may be rotated when active.

#### Thermal Foundation
* [Blocks of charcoal](/docs/1.12/thermal-foundation/block-of-charcoal/) and [blocks
  of coal coke](/docs/1.12/thermal-foundation/block-of-coal-coke/) are flammable.
* [Blizzes](/docs/1.12/thermal-foundation/blizz/),
  [blitzes](/docs/1.12/thermal-foundation/blitz/) and
  [basalzes](/docs/1.12/thermal-foundation/basalz/) will still be registered when
  disabled in the configuration file. They just won't spawn.
* Added a configuration option to disable the crafting recipes for [wooden
  gears](/docs/1.12/thermal-foundation/wooden-gear/) and [stone
  gears](/docs/1.12/thermal-foundation/stone-gear/).
* Added a configuration option to make the other gears require an additional
  [iron ingot](https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Iron_Ingot) to craft.

#### Thermal Expansion
* Added a configuration option for the ore to dust ratio of
  [pulverizers](/docs/1.12/thermal-expansion/pulverizer/).
* Added a configuration option for the wood to planks ratio of
  [sawmills](/docs/1.12/thermal-expansion/sawmill/).
* Added a configuration option for the experience collection radius of
  [insightful condensers](/docs/1.12/thermal-expansion/insightful-condenser/).
* Increased the working area of [creature
  encaptulators](/docs/1.12/thermal-expansion/creature-encaptulator/) from 9x7x9 to
  11x11x11.
* Added a configuration option for the item collection radius of
  [vacuumulators](/docs/1.12/thermal-expansion/vacuumulator/).
* The first line of [augment](/docs/1.12/thermal-expansion/augments/) tooltips is now
  always visible, instead of having to hold Shift. This way, when searching for
  a certain machine or dynamo, any applicable augments are also shown.

#### Thermal Cultivation
* [Watering cans](/docs/1.12/thermal-cultivation/watering-can/) can be used while
  sneaking.
