A **mycelium substrate** is an [augment](/docs/augments/) that allows for a
[phytogenic insolator](/docs/phytogenic-insolator/) to grow
[mushrooms](https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Mushroom).


Obtaining
---------

### Crafting
{% include recipe-table.html type='crafting' recipes=page.recipes.crafting no-result=true %}

Note that [rich Phyto-Gro](/docs/rich-phyto-gro/) can be used to craft mycelium.


Usage
-----

### Installation
A mycelium substrate can be installed in the Augmentation tab in a [phytogenic
insolator](/docs/phytogenic-insolator/)'s GUI. It is a specialization that
cannot be installed together with other specialization augments.

### Effects
An installed mycelium substrate adds some extra [recipes](#recipes) to a
[phytogenic insolator](/docs/phytogenic-insolator/). These recipes allow for
[mushrooms](https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Mushroom) to be grown.

Trivia
------

* Other than mushrooms, a mycelium substrate also allows for slime crops to be
  grown, if those are available. By installing both a mycelium substrate and a
  [sapling infuser](/docs/augment-sapling-infuser/), slime trees can also be
  grown.
