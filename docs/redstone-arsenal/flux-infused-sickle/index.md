A **flux-infused sickle** is a powerful [sickle](/docs/thermal-foundation-2/sickles/) powered by
[Redstone Flux](/docs/redstone-flux/).


Obtaining
---------

### Crafting
{% include recipe-table.html type='crafting' recipes=page.recipes.crafting no-result=true %}


Usage
-----

### Charging
A flux-infused sickle can hold up to 320,000 [RF](/docs/redstone-flux/). It can
be charged using an [energetic infuser](/docs/thermal-expansion/energetic-infuser/), a [flux
capacitor](/docs/thermal-expansion/flux-capacitor/) or similar. It can also be charged by touching
a [fluxed electrum block](/docs/redstone-arsenal/fluxed-electrum-block/) or [flux crystal
block](/docs/redstone-arsenal/flux-crystal-block) while holding it. It can be charged at rates up
to 4,000 RF/t.

### Empowering
A charged flux-infused sickle can be empowered, increasing its power. This can
be toggled by pressing "Cycle Item Mode" (V by default).

### Breaking plants
A charged flux-infused sickle can break up to 49 plant-like blocks in a 7x7 area
(like regular [sickles](/docs/thermal-foundation-2/sickles/)), and consumes 200 RF per use. When
empowered, it can break up to 121 blocks in a 11x11 area, and consumes 1,200 RF
per use.

When sneaking, a flux-infused sickle breaks only one block at a time.

### Weapon
An uncharged flux-infused sickle has an attack speed of 1.4, and deals 2 damage.
When charged, it deals 5 damage as well as 1 flux damage (a special type of
damage that bypasses armor). When empowered, its attack speed is raised to 1.8
and its flux damage is raised to 6.

### Enchantments
A flux-infused sickle has an
[enchantability](https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Enchantability) of 25, which is
slightly higher than that of a [golden sickle](/docs/thermal-foundation-2/sickles/). It can
receive all the enchantments that other sickles can receive.

When enchanted with [Unbreaking](https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Unbreaking), a
flux-infused sickle has a chance to not consume [Redstone
Flux](/docs/redstone-flux/) when used.

| Unbreaking level | No energy use chance |
|---
| I | 33% |
| II | 50% |
| III | 60% |

A flux-infused sickle can also be enchanted with [Holding](/docs/cofh-core-4/holding/) to
increase its energy capacity.

| Holding level | Capacity multiplier |
|---
| I | × 1.5 |
| II | × 2 |
| III | × 2.5 |
| IV | × 3 |
