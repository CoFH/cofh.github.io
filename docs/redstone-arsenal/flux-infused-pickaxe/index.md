A **flux-infused pickaxe** is a powerful
[pickaxe](https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Pickaxe) powered by [Redstone
Flux](/docs/redstone-flux/).


Obtaining
---------

### Crafting
{% include recipe-table.html type='crafting' recipes=page.recipes.crafting no-result=true %}


Usage
-----

### Charging
A flux-infused pickaxe can hold up to 320,000 [RF](/docs/redstone-flux/). It can
be charged using an [energetic infuser](/docs/thermal-expansion/energetic-infuser/), a [flux
capacitor](/docs/thermal-expansion/flux-capacitor/) or similar. It can also be charged by touching
a [fluxed electrum block](/docs/redstone-arsenal/fluxed-electrum-block/) or [flux crystal
block](/docs/redstone-arsenal/flux-crystal-block) while holding it. It can be charged at rates up
to 4,000 RF/t.

An uncharged flux-infused pickaxe is still usable and will not break when used,
but it is much less powerful.

### Empowering
A charged flux-infused pickaxe can be empowered, increasing its power. This can
be toggled by pressing "Cycle Item Mode" (V by default).

### Mining
An uncharged flux-infused pickaxe has a very low mining speed: half the speed of
a [wooden pickaxe](https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Wooden_Pickaxe). When
charged, it has the same mining speed as a [diamond
pickaxe](https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Diamond_Pickaxe), and consumes 200 RF
per use. When empowered, it is 1.5 times as fast as a diamond pickaxe, and
consumes 800 RF per use.

A flux-infused pickaxe can harvest any block that a [diamond
pickaxe](https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Diamond_Pickaxe) can harvest. It is
technically one harvest level more powerful than a diamond pickaxe, but there
are no blocks that require such a powerful pickaxe to harvest in the base game.

When empowered, a flux-infused pickaxe also serves as a
[shovel](https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Shovel).

When a block is broken using an empowered flux-infused pickaxe, two adjacent
blocks are also broken if possible. When mining horizontally, these are the
blocks directly above and below broken blocks, and when mining vertically, these
are the blocks in front of and behind broken blocks.

### Weapon
An uncharged flux-infused pickaxe has an attack speed of 1.2, and deals 2
damage. When charged, it deals 4 damage as well as 1 flux damage (a special type
of damage that bypasses armor). When empowered, its attack speed is raised to
1.6 and its flux damage is raised to 4.

### Enchantments
A flux-infused pickaxe has an
[enchantability](https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Enchantability) of 25, which is
slightly higher than that of a [golden
pickaxe](https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Golden_Pickaxe). It can receive all the
enchantments that other pickaxes can receive.

When enchanted with [Unbreaking](https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Unbreaking), a
flux-infused pickaxe has a chance to not consume [Redstone
Flux](/docs/redstone-flux/) when used.

| Unbreaking level | No energy use chance |
|---
| I | 33% |
| II | 50% |
| III | 60% |

A flux-infused pickaxe can also be enchanted with [Holding](/docs/cofh-core-4/holding/) to
increase its energy capacity.

| Holding level | Capacity multiplier |
|---
| I | × 1.5 |
| II | × 2 |
| III | × 2.5 |
| IV | × 3 |
