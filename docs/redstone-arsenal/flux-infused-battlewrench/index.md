Obtaining
---------

### Crafting
{% include recipe-table.html type='crafting' recipes=page.recipes.crafting no-result=true %}


Usage
-----

### Charging
A flux-infused battlewrench can hold up to 320,000 [RF](/docs/redstone-flux/).
It can be charged using an [energetic infuser](/docs/thermal-expansion/energetic-infuser/), a
[flux capacitor](/docs/thermal-expansion/flux-capacitor/) or similar. It can also be charged by
touching a [fluxed electrum block](/docs/redstone-arsenal/fluxed-electrum-block/) or [flux
crystal block](/docs/redstone-arsenal/flux-crystal-block) while holding it. It can be charged at
rates up to 4,000 RF/t.

An uncharged flux-infused battlewrench is still usable and will not break when
used, but it is much less powerful.

### Empowering
A charged flux-infused battlewrench can be empowered, increasing its power. This
can be toggled by pressing "Cycle Item Mode" (V by default).

### Weapon
A flux-infused battlewrench can be used as a
[sword](https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Sword).

An uncharged flux-infused battlewrench has an attack speed of 1.6, and deals 2
damage. When charged, it deals 6 damage as well as 1 flux damage (a special type
of damage that bypasses armor), and consumes 200 RF per use. When empowered, its
attack speed is raised to 2, its flux damage is raised to 8, and it consumes 800
RF per use.

Players or mobs that are hit with a flux-infused battlewrench are rotated by 90
degrees.

### Wrench
A charged flux-infused battlewrench can be used as a [wrench](/docs/wrenches/).
It consumes 200 RF per use, or 800 RF when empowered.

### Enchantments
A flux-infused battlewrench has an
[enchantability](https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Enchantability) of 25. It can
receive all the enchantments that
[swords](https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Sword) can receive.

When enchanted with [Unbreaking](https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Unbreaking), a
flux-infused battlewrench has a chance to not consume [Redstone
Flux](/docs/redstone-flux/) when used.
