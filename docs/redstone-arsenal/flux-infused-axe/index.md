A **flux-infused axe** is a powerful [axe](https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Axe)
powered by [Redstone Flux](/docs/redstone-flux/).


Obtaining
---------

### Crafting
{% include recipe-table.html type='crafting' recipes=page.recipes.crafting no-result=true %}


Usage
-----

### Charging
A flux-infused axe can hold up to 320,000 [RF](/docs/redstone-flux/). It can be
charged using an [energetic infuser](/docs/thermal-expansion-5/energetic-infuser/), a [flux
capacitor](/docs/thermal-expansion-5/flux-capacitor/) or similar. It can also be charged by touching
a [fluxed electrum block](/docs/redstone-arsenal/fluxed-electrum-block/) or [flux crystal
block](/docs/redstone-arsenal/flux-crystal-block) while holding it. It can be charged at rates up
to 4,000 RF/t.

An uncharged flux-infused axe is still usable and will not break when used, but
it is much less powerful.

### Empowering
A charged flux-infused axe can be empowered, increasing its power. This can be
toggled by pressing "Cycle Item Mode" (V by default).

### Chopping wood
An uncharged flux-infused axe has a very low chopping speed: half the speed of a
[wooden axe](https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Wooden_Axe). When charged, it has
the same chopping speed as a [diamond
axe](https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Diamond_Axe), and consumes 200 RF per use.
When empowered, it is 1.5 times as fast as a diamond axe, and consumes 1,600 RF
per use.

When a block is broken using an empowered flux-infused axe, all choppable blocks
in a vertical 3x5x3 area around the broken block are also broken if possible.

### Weapon
An uncharged flux-infused axe has an attack speed of 1.2, and deals 2 damage.
When charged, it deals 8 damage as well as 1 flux damage (a special type of
damage that bypasses armor). When empowered, its attack speed is raised to 1.6
and its flux damage is raised to 6.

### Enchantments
A flux-infused axe has an
[enchantability](https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Enchantability) of 25, which is
slightly higher than that of a [golden
axe](https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Golden_Axe). It can receive all the
enchantments that other axes can receive.

When enchanted with [Unbreaking](https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Unbreaking), a
flux-infused axe has a chance to not consume [Redstone
Flux](/docs/redstone-flux/) when used.

| Unbreaking level | No energy use chance |
|---
| I | 33% |
| II | 50% |
| III | 60% |

A flux-infused axe can also be enchanted with [Holding](/docs/cofh-core-4/holding/) to
increase its energy capacity.

| Holding level | Capacity multiplier |
|---
| I | × 1.5 |
| II | × 2 |
| III | × 2.5 |
| IV | × 3 |
