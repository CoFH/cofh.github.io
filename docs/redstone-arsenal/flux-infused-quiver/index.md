A **flux-infused quiver** is a [Redstone Flux](/docs/redstone-flux/)-powered
item that provides powerful ammunition for
[bows](https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Bow) when charged.

### Crafting

Usage
-----

### Charging
A flux-infused quiver can hold up to 320,000 [RF](/docs/redstone-flux/). It can
be charged using an [energetic infuser](/docs/thermal-expansion-5/energetic-infuser/), a [flux
capacitor](/docs/thermal-expansion-5/flux-capacitor/) or similar. It can also be charged by touching
a [fluxed electrum block](/docs/redstone-arsenal/fluxed-electrum-block/) or [flux crystal
block](/docs/redstone-arsenal/flux-crystal-block) while holding it. It can be charged at rates up
to 4,000 RF/t.

### Empowering
A charged flux-infused quiver can be empowered, increasing its power. This can
be toggled by pressing "Cycle Item Mode" (V by default).

### Ammunition
A charged flux-infused quiver serves as ammunition for
[bows](https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Bows). It makes bows shoot arrows that
are unaffected by gravity and disappear on impact (or after travelling for too
long).

Arrows from a flux-infused quiver deal the same amount of damage as regular
[arrows](https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Arrows). They deal flux damage, a
special type of damage that bypasses armor. Each arrow costs 800 RF to fire.

When a flux-infused quiver is empowered, its arrows deal twice as much damage.
They also cause an explosion (that doesn't destroy blocks) on impact. Most
[mobs](https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Mob) can be killed with a single
empowered arrow. Each empowered arrow costs 6,400 RF to fire.

### Enchantments
A flux-infused quiver has an
[enchantability](https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Enchantability) of 10. It can
be enchanted with [Holding](/docs/cofh-core-4/holding/) to increase its energy capacity.

| Holding level | Capacity multiplier |

| I | × 1.5 |
| II | × 2 |
| III | × 2.5 |
| IV | × 3 |
