**Energized netherrack** is a rare [ore](https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Ore)
that can be found in the [Nether](https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/The_Nether).


Obtaining
---------
Energized netherrack occurs rarely in the lower levels of the Nether (layers
10-40). It occurs in fairly large deposits, about as large as deposits of [coal
ore](https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Coal_Ore). Deposits of energized netherrack
may also contain some [energized glowstone](/docs/energized-glowstone/).

Energized netherrack must be mined with a [stone
pickaxe](https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Pickaxe) or better. It drops one piece
of [energized clathrate](/docs/energized-clathrate/) when mined. More clathrate
is dropped if a [Fortune](https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Fortune) enchanted
pickaxe is used. The ore block itself can be obtained by mining it with a [Silk
Touch](https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Silk_Touch) enchanted pickaxe.

When energized netherrack is broken, some [energized
glowstone](/docs/energized-glowstone/) comes flowing out. This fluid cannot be
picked up and eventually disappears.
