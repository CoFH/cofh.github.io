A **sapling infuser** is an [augment](/docs/augments/) that allows for a
[phytogenic insolator](/docs/phytogenic-insolator/) to grow
[trees](https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Tree).


Obtaining
---------

### Crafting
{% include recipe-table.html type='crafting' recipes=page.recipes.crafting no-result=true %}


Usage
-----

### Installation
A sapling infuser can be installed in the Augmentation tab in a [phytogenic
insolator](/docs/phytogenic-insolator/)'s GUI.

### Effects
An installed sapling infuser adds some extra [recipes](#recipes) to a
[phytogenic insolator](/docs/phytogenic-insolator/). These recipes allow for
[wood](https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Wood) to be produced from
[saplings](https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Sapling).

If a [mycelium](/docs/augment-mycelium-substrate/),
[nether](/docs/augment-nether-substrate/) or [ender
substrate](/docs/augment-ender-substrate/) is also installed, its corresponding
tree types can also be grown.
