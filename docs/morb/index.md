Usage
-----

### Capturing mobs
When a morb is thrown at a [mob](https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Mob), the mob
is captured and stored inside the morb.

### Releasing mobs
A filled morb can be thrown to release the contained
[mob](https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Mob). The morb has a 75% chance of
breaking after releasing the mob.

### Centrifugal Separator with Enstabulation Apparatus
A [centrifugal separator](/docs/centrifugal-separator/) with an [enstabulation
apparatus](/docs/augment-enstabulation-apparatus/) installed processes filled
morbs into [mob](https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Mob) drops and [essence of
knowledge](/docs/essence-of-knowledge/). When processing morbs, there is a 20%
chance that an empty morb is returned as an output.
