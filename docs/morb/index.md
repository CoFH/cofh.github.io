Usage

### Capturing mobs
A morb can be used to capture the essence of a type of
[mob](https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Mob) by throwing it at a mob.

### Spawning mobs
A filled morb can be thrown to spawn a generic
[mob](https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Mob) of the contained type. This empties
the morb. The morb has a 75% chance of breaking after spawning the mob.
