A **numismatic press** is an [augment](/docs/augments/) that allows for a
[compactor](/docs/compactor/) to produce metal coins.


Obtaining
---------

### Crafting
{% include recipe-table.html type='crafting' recipes=page.recipes.crafting no-result=true %}


Usage
-----

### Installation
A numismatic press can be installed in the Augmentation tab in a
[compactor](/docs/compactor/)'s GUI. It is a specialization that cannot be
installed together with other specialization augments.

### Effects
An installed numismatic press allows for a [compactor](/docs/compactor/) to be
switched into Mint mode. In this mode, the compactor produces metal coins from
metal nuggets, ingots and blocks.
