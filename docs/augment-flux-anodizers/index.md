A **flux anodizers** [augment](/docs/augments/) doubles the amount of ingots a
[redstone furnace](/docs/redstone-furnace/) produces when processing metal ores.


Obtaining
---------

### Crafting
{% include recipe-table.html type='crafting' recipes=page.recipes.crafting no-result=true %}


Usage
-----

### Installation
A flux anodizers augment can be installed in the Augmentation tab in a [redstone
furnace](/docs/redstone-furnace/)'s GUI. It is a specialization that cannot be
installed together with other specialization augments.

### Effects
A [redstone furnace](/docs/redstone-furnace/) with flux anodizers installed
smelts each unit of metal ore into two ingots. However, the machine cannot
process anything other than metal ores, and the amount of energy required per
operation is increased by 50%.

If flux anodizers are installed together with other augments that increase the
amount of energy required per operation, their energy increase percentages are
added together before being applied to the amount of energy.
