**`surface`** is one of the [distribution types](../) provided by [CoFH
World](../../../). It distributes features on the surface. It does so by
randomly picking X and Z coordinates and placing features on top of the highest
blocks at those coordinates.

When using this distribution type, the feature type
[`cluster`](../../feature-types/cluster/) is used by default, and the value
`material` of [feature type
configurations](../../feature-format/#feature-type-configuration) is set to
[stone](https://minecraft.wiki/w/Stone),
[dirt](https://minecraft.wiki/w/Dirt), [grass
blocks](https://minecraft.wiki/w/Grass_Block),
[sand](https://minecraft.wiki/w/Sand),
[gravel](https://minecraft.wiki/w/Gravel),
[snow](https://minecraft.wiki/w/Snow_Block),
[air](https://minecraft.wiki/w/Air) and
[water](https://minecraft.wiki/w/Water) (and all variations of these
blocks) by default. Note that air is included because air blocks must be
replaced when generating features on the surface.


Options
-------

When using this distribution type, the following values may be added to the
[feature entry](../../feature-format/#features).

<div class="uk-overflow-container">
    <table class="uk-table uk-table-striped uk-text-small">
        <thead>
            <tr>

                    (Same as default `material` value of
                    [feature type configurations](../../feature-format/#feature-type-configuration),
                    described above)

                    The type(s) of block that features may be placed on top of.
                    A feature will only be generated at randomly chosen X and Z
                    coordinates if the type of the highest block at those
                    coordinates is specified here. Otherwise, the feature is
                    skipped, but still counts towards the value `cluster-count`
                    of the
                    [feature entry](../../feature-format/#features).

                    that make up trees, as well as 'replaceable' blocks such as
                    small plants and fluids, are ignored. If `true`, any block
                    counts when finding the highest block.<br />

                    (Yes, the effects of `true` and `false` are the wrong way
                    around. It's kept this way for now to not break existing
                    configurations.)
