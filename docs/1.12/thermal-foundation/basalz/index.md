**Basalzes** are hostile mobs found in mountainous and/or barren
[biomes](https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Biome). They drop [basalz
rods](../basalz-rod/).


Appearance
----------

Basalzes closely resemble [blazes](https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Blaze). This
is because both mobs are elementals, with blazes being fire elementals and
basalzes being earth elementals.

Instead of smoke, basalzes produce small dust particles.

Basalzes make muffled breathing sounds, as well as a sound that sounds like
falling stones.


Spawning
--------

Basalzes spawn in mountainous and/or barren
[biomes](https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Biome) such as [extreme
hills](https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Extreme_Hills). They spawn on solid
blocks at light level 8 or less. Basalzes spawn in groups of 1-4 and are rarer
than most other mobs.


Drops
-----

When killed by a player, basalzes may drop up to two pieces of [pulverized
obsidian](../pulverized-obsidian/), and may drop one [basalz
rod](../basalz-rod/). They drop more items if a
[Looting](https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Looting) enchanted weapon is used.


Behavior
--------

When idle, a basalz wanders around on the ground. When it sees a player, it
starts flying and attacking. Basalzes attack by shooting "basalz bolts", which
are projectiles that deal damage and may apply the effect [Weakness
II](https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Weakness) for 5 seconds.


Trivia
------

* During Christmas, basalzes may wear Santa hats.
