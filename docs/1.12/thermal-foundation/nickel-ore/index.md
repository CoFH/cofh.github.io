![Nickel ore](/assets/images/thermal-foundation-2/ore-nickel.png){:style="height: 128px"}


**Nickel ore** is an uncommon [ore](https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Ore) that
yields [nickel](/docs/1.12/thermal-foundation/nickel-ingot/) and small amounts of
[platinum](/docs/1.12/thermal-foundation/platinum-ingot/).


Obtaining
---------

Nickel ore is about as common as [gold
ore](https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Gold_Ore), but it occurs at fewer levels
(layers 5-20). Veins of nickel ore are also relatively small.

Nickel ore must be mined with an [iron
pickaxe](https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Pickaxe) or better. If it is mined, it
drops itself as an item.


Usage
-----

### Smelting
{% include recipe-table.html type='smelting' recipes=page.usage-recipes.smelting %}

### Crafting
{% include recipe-table.html type='crafting' recipes=page.usage-recipes.crafting %}

### Pulverizer
{% include recipe-table.html type='te5-pulverizer' recipes=page.usage-recipes.pulverizer %}

### Induction Smelter
{% include recipe-table.html type='te5-smelter' recipes=page.usage-recipes.smelter %}

### Smashing
When nickel ore is broken using a [Smashing](/docs/1.12/cofh-core/smashing/)
enchanted [pickaxe](https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Pickaxe) or similar tool,
two piles of [pulverized nickel](/docs/1.12/thermal-foundation/pulverized-nickel/)
are dropped instead of the ore.


Trivia
------

* Nickel ore is generated in the world using [CoFH World](/docs/1.12/cofh-world/) by
  default. The world generation can be tweaked or disabled using CoFH World's
  [configuration](/docs/1.12/cofh-world/world-generator-configuration/).
