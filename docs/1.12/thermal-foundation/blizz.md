**Blizzes** are hostile mobs found in cold
[biomes](https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Biome). They drop [blizz
rods](../blizz-rod/).


Appearance
----------

Blizzes closely resemble [blazes](https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Blaze). This
is because both mobs are elementals, with blazes being fire elementals and
blizzes being ice elementals.

Instead of smoke, blizzes produce snow particles.

Blizzes make cold breathing sounds, as well as a cracking ice sound.


Spawning
--------

Blizzes spawn in cold [biomes](https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Biome). They
spawn on solid blocks at light level 8 or less. Blizzes spawn in groups of 1-4
and are rarer than most other mobs.


Drops
-----

When killed by a player, blizzes may drop up to four
[snowballs](https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Snowball), and may drop one [blizz
rod](../blizz-rod/). They drop more items if a
[Looting](https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Looting) enchanted weapon is used.


Behavior
--------

When idle, a blizz wanders around on the ground. When it sees a player, it
starts flying and attacking. Blizzes attack by shooting "blizz bolts", which are
projectiles that deal damage and may apply the effect [Slowness
II](https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Slowness) for 5 seconds.


Trivia
------

* A group of blizzes is called a "blizzard".
* During Christmas, blizzes may wear Santa hats.
