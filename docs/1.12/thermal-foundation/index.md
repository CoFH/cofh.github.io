**Thermal Foundation** is a mod for Minecraft 1.12. It adds basic materials and
tools that are used by the other "Thermal" mods for that version of the game. It
also adds basic tools, weapons and armor made of the various new materials.

When Thermal Foundation 2 is installed, several new features such as ores are
generated in the world using [CoFH World](../cofh-world/). This world generation
can be tweaked or disabled using CoFH World's
[configuration](../cofh-world/world-generator-configuration/).
