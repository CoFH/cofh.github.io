![Tar](/assets/images/docs/1.12/thermal-foundation/tar.png){:style="height: 128px"}


**Tar** is a byproduct of processing [oil sand](../oil-sand/) in a
[pulverizer](../../thermal-expansion/pulverizer/), and of processing [liquifacted
coal](../liquifacted-coal/) or [crude oil](../crude-oil/) in a
[fractionating still](../../thermal-expansion/fractionating-still/). It can be used to craft
[torches](https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Torches), and can replace
[slimeballs](https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Slimeball) in some recipes.


Obtaining

### Fractionating Still
{% include docs/recipe/table/table.html recipe-type='refinery' recipe-ids=page.recipes.refinery no-result=true %}


Usage
-----

### Crafting ingredient
{% include docs/recipe/table/table.html recipe-type='crafting-shaped' recipe-ids=page.usage-recipes.crafting-shaped %}

When used as fuel in a [furnace](https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Furnace), one
piece of tar lasts 40 seconds, which is enough to smelt up to 4 items.
