![Lumium ingot](/assets/images/docs/1.12/thermal-foundation/ingot-lumium.png){:style="height: 128px"}


**Lumium ingots** are raw materials made from [tin](../tin-ingot/),
[silver](../silver-ingot/) and [energized
glowstone](../energized-glowstone/).


Obtaining
---------

Lumium is an advanced alloy that can be obtained by crafting [lumium
blend](../lumium-blend/). The
blend can only be smelted into ingots in an [induction
smelter](../../thermal-expansion/induction-smelter/).

Trivia
------

* If [Tinkers'
  Construct](https://minecraft.curseforge.com/projects/tinkers-construct) is
  installed, lumium can be molten down in a smeltery. Molten lumium can also be
  made by mixing molten [tin](../tin-ingot/), molten
  [silver](../silver-ingot/) and [energized
  glowstone](../energized-glowstone/).
