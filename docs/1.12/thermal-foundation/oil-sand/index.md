**Oil sand** is an uncommon [ore](https://minecraft.wiki/w/Ore) that
yields [bitumen](../bitumen/) ([crude oil](../crude-oil/)) and small
amounts of [tar](../tar/). It comes in regular
[sand](https://minecraft.wiki/w/Sand) and [red
sand](https://minecraft.wiki/w/Red_Sand) variants.


Obtaining
---------

Oil sand occurs fairly uncommonly in
[deserts](https://minecraft.wiki/w/Desert) and similar biomes, in veins
between [sand](https://minecraft.wiki/w/Sand),
[sandstone](https://minecraft.wiki/w/Sandstone) and
[stone](https://minecraft.wiki/w/Stone) blocks. It is found at almost any
altitude (layers 10-80). It occurs in fairly large deposits, almost as large as
deposits of [coal ore](https://minecraft.wiki/w/Coal_Ore).

Oil sand also more rarely occurs in much larger deposits underground (layers
30-60), surrounding a small amount of [crude oil](../crude-oil/).

Oil sand must be mined with a [stone
pickaxe](https://minecraft.wiki/w/Stone_Pickaxe) or
[shovel](https://minecraft.wiki/w/Stone_Shovel) or better. It drops one
piece of [bitumen](../bitumen/) when mined. More bitumen is dropped if a
[Fortune](https://minecraft.wiki/w/Fortune) enchanted tool is used. Oil
sand itself can be obtained by mining it with a [Silk
Touch](https://minecraft.wiki/w/Silk_Touch) enchanted tool.

When oil sand is broken, some [crude oil](../crude-oil/) comes flowing out.
This oil cannot be picked up and eventually disappears. If a Silk Touch
enchanted tool is used, no fluid comes flowing out.

Trivia

  default. The world generation can be tweaked or disabled using CoFH World's
  [configuration](../../cofh-world/world-generator-configuration/).
