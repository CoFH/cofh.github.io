**Sap** is a fluid obtained from oak and dark oak
[trees](https://minecraft.wiki/w/Tree). It can be used to turn [regular
Phyto-Gro](../phyto-gro/) into [rich Phyto-Gro](../rich-phyto-gro/).


Obtaining
---------

### Arboreal Extractor
An [arboreal extractor](../../thermal-expansion/arboreal-extractor/) will
produce sap when placed next to an oak or dark oak
[tree](https://minecraft.wiki/w/Tree). Dark oak trees produce twice as
much sap as oak trees.

### Sawmill with Resin Funnel
A [sawmill](../../thermal-expansion/sawmill/) with a [resin
funnel](../../thermal-expansion/augment-resin-funnel/) installed produces sap as
a byproduct when processing oak or dark oak
[wood](https://minecraft.wiki/w/Wood). Dark oak wood yields twice as much
sap as oak wood.
