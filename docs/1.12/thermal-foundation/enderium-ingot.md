![Enderium ingot](/assets/images/docs/1.12/thermal-foundation/ingot-enderium.png){:style="height: 128px"}


**Enderium ingots** are raw materials made from [lead](../lead-ingot/),
[platinum](../platinum-ingot/) and [resonant ender](../resonant-ender/).


Obtaining
---------

Enderium is an advanced alloy that can be obtained by crafting [enderium
blend](../enderium-blend/). The blend can only be smelted into ingots in an
[induction smelter](../../thermal-expansion/induction-smelter/).

Trivia
------

* If [Tinkers'
  Construct](https://minecraft.curseforge.com/projects/tinkers-construct) is
  installed, enderium can be molten down in a smeltery. Molten enderium can also
  be made by mixing molten [lead](../lead-ingot/), molten
  [platinum](../platinum-ingot/) and [resonant ender](../resonant-ender/).
