![Signalum ingot](/assets/images/docs/1.12/thermal-foundation/ingot-signalum.png){:style="height: 128px"}


**Signalum ingots** are raw materials made from [copper](../copper-ingot/),
[silver](../silver-ingot/) and [destabilized
redstone](../destabilized-redstone/).


Obtaining
---------

Signalum is an advanced alloy that can be obtained by crafting [signalum
blend](../signalum-blend/). The blend can only be smelted into ingots in an
[induction smelter](../../thermal-expansion/induction-smelter/).

Trivia
------

* If [Tinkers'
  Construct](https://minecraft.curseforge.com/projects/tinkers-construct) is
  installed, signalum can be molten down in a smeltery. Molten signalum can also
  be made by mixing molten [copper](../copper-ingot/), molten
  [silver](../silver-ingot/) and [destabilized
  redstone](../destabilized-redstone/).
