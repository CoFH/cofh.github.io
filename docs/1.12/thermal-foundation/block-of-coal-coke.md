**Blocks of coal coke** are blocks made from [coal coke](../coal-coke/).


Obtaining
---------

Blocks of coal coke can only be mined with a [wooden
pickaxe](https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Pickaxe) or better.

### Crafting
{% include docs/recipe/table/table.html recipe-type='crafting-shaped' recipe-ids=page.recipes.crafting-shaped no-result=true %}

### Redstone Furnace with Pyrolytic Conversion
{% include docs/recipe/table/table.html recipe-type='redstone-furnace-pyrolysis' recipe-ids=page.recipes.redstone-furnace-pyrolysis no-result=true %}


Usage
-----

Placed blocks of coal coke are flammable.

### Storage
Blocks of coal coke can be used to store [coal coke](../coal-coke/) in a
compact way.

### Fuel
When used as fuel in a [furnace](https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Furnace), one
block of coal coke lasts 1,600 seconds, which is enough to smelt up to 160
items. It lasts slightly longer than 9 individual pieces of coal coke.
