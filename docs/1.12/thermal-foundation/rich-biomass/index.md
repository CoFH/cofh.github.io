**Rich biomass** is a material obtained by infusing [pulped
biomass](/docs/1.12/thermal-foundation/pulped-biomass/) with [seed
oil](/docs/1.12/thermal-foundation/seed-oil/). It can be processed into
[biocrude](/docs/1.12/thermal-foundation/biocrude/), which can then be processed into
[grassoline](/docs/1.12/thermal-foundation/grassoline/). Rich biomass yields more
biocrude than the regular variant.
