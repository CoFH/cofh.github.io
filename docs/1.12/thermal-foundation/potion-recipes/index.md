[Thermal Foundation](../) adds recipes to obtain the new
[potions](../../cofh-core/potions/) added by [CoFH Core](../../cofh-core/).


Brewing
-------

Most [potions](../../cofh-core/potions/) added by [CoFH Core](../../cofh-core/)
can be [brewed](https://minecraft.wiki/w/Brewing) by adding certain
ingredients to [awkward
potions](https://minecraft.wiki/w/Potion#Base_potions).

| Potion | Ingredient |
|---
| Potion of Haste | [Basalz Powder](../basalz-powder/) |
| Potion of Resistance | [Pulverized Obsidian](../pulverized-obsidian/) |
| Potion of Levitation | [Blitz Powder](../blitz-powder/) |
| Potion of Absorption | [Blizz Powder](../blizz-powder/) |
| Potion of Luck | [Emerald](https://minecraft.wiki/w/Emerald) |

Potions of misfortune and decay can be brewed by adding [fermented spider
eyes](https://minecraft.wiki/w/Fermented_Spider_Eye) to potions of luck
and regeneration, respectively.

Like with other potions, [redstone](https://minecraft.wiki/w/Redstone)
and [glowstone dust](https://minecraft.wiki/w/Glowstone_Dust) can be used
to extend the duration and increase the strength of these potions.
