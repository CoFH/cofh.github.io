**Destabilized redstone ore** is a rare
[ore](https://minecraft.wiki/w/Ore) that yields [destabilized
clathrate](../destabilized-clathrate/) ([destabilized
redstone](../destabilized-redstone/)) and small amounts of
[cinnabar](../cinnabar/).


Obtaining
---------

Destabilized redstone ore is relatively rare. It occurs underground at around
the same levels as [redstone ore](https://minecraft.wiki/w/Redstone_Ore)
(layers 0-20). It occurs in fairly large deposits, almost as large as deposits
of [coal ore](https://minecraft.wiki/w/Coal_Ore). Deposits of
destabilized redstone ore may also contain some [destabilized
redstone](../destabilized-redstone/).

Destabilized redstone ore must be mined with a [stone
pickaxe](https://minecraft.wiki/w/Pickaxe) or better. It drops one piece
of [destabilized clathrate](../destabilized-clathrate/) when mined. More
clathrate is dropped if a [Fortune](https://minecraft.wiki/w/Fortune)
enchanted pickaxe is used. The ore block itself can be obtained by mining it
with a [Silk Touch](https://minecraft.wiki/w/Silk_Touch) enchanted
pickaxe.

When destabilized redstone ore is broken, some [destabilized
redstone](../destabilized-redstone/) comes flowing out. This fluid cannot be
picked up and eventually disappears. If a Silk Touch enchanted pickaxe is used,
no fluid comes flowing out.

Trivia
------

* Destabilized redstone ore is generated in the world using [CoFH
  World](../../cofh-world/) by default. The world generation can be tweaked or
  disabled using CoFH World's
  [configuration](../../cofh-world/world-generator-configuration/).
