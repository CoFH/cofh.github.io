**Tree oil** is a fluid obtained by processing [resin](../resin/) in a
[fractionating still](../../thermal-expansion/fractionating-still/). It can be used as fuel in a
[compression dynamo](../../thermal-expansion/compression-dynamo/).


Obtaining
---------

### Fractionating Still
{% include docs/recipe/table/table.html recipe-type='refinery' recipe-ids=page.recipes.refinery %}

### Fluid Transposer
{% include docs/recipe/table/table.html recipe-type='transposer-empty' recipe-ids=page.recipes.transposer-empty %}


Usage
-----

Tree oil cannot be placed as a block.

### Fluid Transposer ingredient
{% include docs/recipe/table/table.html recipe-type='transposer-fill' recipe-ids=page.usage-recipes.transposer-fill %}

### Compression Dynamo fuel
When used as fuel in a [compression
dynamo](../../thermal-expansion/compression-dynamo/), a bucket of tree oil
yields 400,000 RF.
