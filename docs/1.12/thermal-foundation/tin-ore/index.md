**Tin ore** is a common [ore](https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Ore) that yields
[tin](/docs/1.12/thermal-foundation/tin-ingot/) and small amounts of
[iron](https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Iron_Ingot).


Obtaining
---------

Tin ore is about as common as [iron
ore](https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Iron_Ore), but it occurs at fewer levels
(layers 20-55). Veins of tin ore are also slightly smaller.

Tin ore must be mined with a [stone
pickaxe](https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Pickaxe) or better. If it is mined, it
drops itself as an item.


Usage
-----

### Smelting
{% include recipe-table.html type='smelting' recipes=page.usage-recipes.smelting %}

### Crafting
{% include recipe-table.html type='crafting' recipes=page.usage-recipes.crafting %}

### Pulverizer
{% include recipe-table.html type='te-1-12-pulverizer' recipes=page.usage-recipes.pulverizer %}

### Induction Smelter
{% include recipe-table.html type='te-1-12-smelter' recipes=page.usage-recipes.smelter %}

### Smashing
When tin ore is broken using a [Smashing](/docs/1.12/cofh-core/smashing/) enchanted
[pickaxe](https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Pickaxe) or similar tool, two piles of
[pulverized tin](/docs/1.12/thermal-foundation/pulverized-tin/) are dropped instead
of the ore.


Trivia
------

* Tin ore is generated in the world using [CoFH World](/docs/1.12/cofh-world/) by
  default. The world generation can be tweaked or disabled using CoFH World's
  [configuration](/docs/1.12/cofh-world/world-generator-configuration/).
