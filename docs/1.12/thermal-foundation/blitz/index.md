**Blitzes** are hostile mobs found in
[deserts](https://minecraft.wiki/w/Desert) and
[savannas](https://minecraft.wiki/w/Savanna). They drop [blitz
rods](../blitz-rod/).


Appearance
----------

Blitzes closely resemble [blazes](https://minecraft.wiki/w/Blaze). This
is because both mobs are elementals, with blazes being fire elementals and
blitzes being air elementals.

Instead of black smoke, blitzes produce white smoke.

Blitzes make short breathing sounds, as well as a wind sound.


Spawning
--------

Blitzes spawn in [deserts](https://minecraft.wiki/w/Desert),
[savannas](https://minecraft.wiki/w/Savanna) and similar
[biomes](https://minecraft.wiki/w/Biome). They spawn on solid blocks at
light level 8 or less. Blitzes spawn in groups of 1-4 and are rarer than most
other mobs.


Drops
-----

When killed by a player, blitzes may drop up to two pieces of
[niter](../niter/), and may drop one [blitz rod](../blitz-rod/). They drop
more items if a [Looting](https://minecraft.wiki/w/Looting) enchanted
weapon is used.


Behavior
--------

When idle, a blitz wanders around on the ground. When it sees a player, it
starts flying and attacking. Blitzes attack by shooting "blitz bolts", which are
projectiles that deal damage and may apply the effect [Blindness
II](https://minecraft.wiki/w/Blindness) for 5 seconds.


Trivia
------

* During Christmas, blitzes may wear Santa hats.
