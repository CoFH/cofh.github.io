[Thermal Foundation](/docs/1.12/thermal-foundation/) adds fluid forms of all
[potions](https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Potion), [splash
potions](https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Splash_Potion) and [lingering
potions](https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Lingering_Potion).


Obtaining
---------

### Fluid Transposer
A [fluid transposer](/docs/1.12/thermal-expansion/fluid-transposer/) can extract potions from their
[bottles](https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Glass_Bottle). This requires 800 RF of
energy and yields 250 mB of fluid per potion.

### Alchemical Imbuer
An [alchemical imbuer](/docs/1.12/thermal-expansion/alchemical-imbuer/) can brew
[water](https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Water) into fluid potions using
[brewing](https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Brewing) ingredients.


Usage
-----

### Fluid Transposer
A [fluid transposer](/docs/1.12/thermal-expansion/fluid-transposer/) can fill [glass
bottles](https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Glass_Bottle) with fluid potions,
producing regular potion items. This requires 800 RF of energy and 250 mB of
fluid per potion.

### Alchemical Imbuer
An [alchemical imbuer](/docs/1.12/thermal-expansion/alchemical-imbuer/) can be used to further brew
fluid potions using [brewing](https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Brewing)
ingredients.

### Fractionating Still with Alchemical Retort
A [fractionating still](/docs/1.12/thermal-expansion/fractionating-still/) with an [alchemical
retort](/docs/1.12/thermal-expansion/augment-alchemical-retort/) installed refines fluid potions,
increasing their potency to levels that cannot be obtained through
[brewing](https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Brewing).

### Decoctive Diffuser
A [decoctive diffuser](/docs/1.12/thermal-expansion/decoctive-diffuser/) applies the effects of a fluid
potion in an area. Its range increases when using a fluid [splash
potion](https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Splash_Potion) or [lingering
potion](https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Lingering_Potion).

### Hypoinfuser
A [hypoinfuser](/docs/1.12/thermal-innovation/hypoinfuser/) can store a fluid potion and infuse the
wielder with it. It can also be used to forcibly inject a potion into other
players or [mobs](https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Mob). It only works with
regular potions; it does not work with [splash
potions](https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Splash_Potion) or [lingering
potions](https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Lingering_Potion).

### Alchemical Quiver
An [alchemical quiver](/docs/1.12/thermal-innovation/alchemical-quiver/) can store a fluid potion and
automatically imbue [arrows](https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Arrow) with it,
turning them into [tipped arrows](https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Tipped_Arrow).
