**Essence of knowledge** is a fluid form of
[experience](https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Experience).

One [experience point](https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Experience) is worth 20
mB of essence of knowledge.


Obtaining
---------

### Tome of Knowledge
Essence of knowledge can be drained from a [tome of
knowledge](/docs/1.12/thermal-foundation/tome-of-knowledge/) that is holding
[experience](https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Experience). This can be done
manually by using the item on blocks that store fluids, or automatically using
[fluid transposers](/docs/1.12/thermal-expansion/fluid-transposer/) or similar.

### Insightful Condenser
An [insightful condenser](/docs/1.12/thermal-expansion/insightful-condenser/) collects nearby
[experience orbs](https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Experience) and converts them
into essence of knowledge.

### Centrifugal Separator with Enstabulation Apparatus
A [centrifugal separator](/docs/1.12/thermal-expansion/centrifugal-separator/) with an [enstabulation
apparatus](/docs/1.12/thermal-expansion/augment-enstabulation-apparatus/) installed produces essence of
knowledge when processing filled [morbs](/docs/1.12/thermal-expansion/morb/).

### Tome of Knowledge
A [tome of knowledge](/docs/1.12/thermal-foundation/tome-of-knowledge/) can be filled with essence of
knowledge, converting it into [experience
points](https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Experience). This can be done manually
by using it on blocks that store fluids, or automatically using [fluid
transposers](/docs/1.12/thermal-expansion/fluid-transposer/) or similar.

### Arcane Ensorcellator
An [arcane ensorcellator](/docs/1.12/thermal-expansion/arcane-ensorcellator/) uses essence of knowledge

books](https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Enchanted_Book).

An [energetic infuser](/docs/1.12/thermal-expansion/energetic-infuser/) with [flux
reconstruction](/docs/1.12/thermal-expansion/augment-flux-reconstruction/) installed uses essence of
knowledge to repair damaged items. It uses 5 mB of essence of knowledge per
restored durability point.
