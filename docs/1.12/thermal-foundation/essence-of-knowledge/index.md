mB of essence of knowledge.

Essence of knowledge can be drained from a [tome of
knowledge](../tome-of-knowledge/) that is holding

manually by using the item on blocks that store fluids, or automatically using
[fluid transposers](../../thermal-expansion/fluid-transposer/) or similar.

### Insightful Condenser

A [centrifugal separator](../../thermal-expansion/centrifugal-separator/) with an [enstabulation
apparatus](../../thermal-expansion/augment-enstabulation-apparatus/) installed produces essence of
knowledge when processing filled [morbs](../../thermal-expansion/morb/).
