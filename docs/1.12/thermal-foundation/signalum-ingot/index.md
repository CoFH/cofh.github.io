**Signalum ingots** are raw materials made from [copper](/docs/1.12/thermal-foundation/copper-ingot/),
[silver](/docs/1.12/thermal-foundation/silver-ingot/) and [destabilized
redstone](/docs/1.12/thermal-foundation/destabilized-redstone/).


Obtaining
---------

Signalum is an advanced alloy that can be obtained by crafting [signalum
blend](/docs/1.12/thermal-foundation/signalum-blend/). The blend can only be smelted into ingots in an
[induction smelter](/docs/1.12/thermal-expansion/induction-smelter/).

Trivia
------

* If [Tinkers'
  Construct](https://minecraft.curseforge.com/projects/tinkers-construct) is
  installed, signalum can be molten down in a smeltery. Molten signalum can also
  be made by mixing molten [copper](/docs/1.12/thermal-foundation/copper-ingot/), molten
  [silver](/docs/1.12/thermal-foundation/silver-ingot/) and [destabilized
  redstone](/docs/1.12/thermal-foundation/destabilized-redstone/).
