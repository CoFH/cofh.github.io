**Vanilla+ Satchels** is a mod for Minecraft 1.12. It adds [satchels](satchel/):
items that store other items, and are able to automatically store picked up
items. They are functionally identical to the
[satchels](../thermal-expansion/satchel/) provided by [Thermal
Expansion](../thermal-expansion/), but are made of materials that are available
in the base game.
