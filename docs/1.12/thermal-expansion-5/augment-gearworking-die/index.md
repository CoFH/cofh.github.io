A **gearworking die** is an [augment](/docs/1.12/thermal-expansion-5/augments/) that
allows for a [compactor](/docs/1.12/thermal-expansion-5/compactor/) to produce gears
instead of plates.


Obtaining
---------

### Crafting
{% include recipe-table.html type='crafting' recipes=page.recipes.crafting no-result=true %}


Usage
-----

### Installation
A gearworking die can be installed in the Augmentation tab in a
[compactor](/docs/1.12/thermal-expansion-5/compactor/)'s GUI. It is a specialization that cannot be
installed together with other specialization augments.

### Effects
An installed gearworking die allows for a
[compactor](/docs/1.12/thermal-expansion-5/compactor/) to produce gears from ingots and
gems. This replaces the machine's ability to produce plates.

Unlike with manual crafting, no additional ingots (usually
[iron](https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Iron_Ingot)) are required to produce
gears using a gearworking die.
