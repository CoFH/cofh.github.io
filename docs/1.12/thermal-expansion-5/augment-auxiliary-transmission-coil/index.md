An **auxiliary transmission coil** is an [augment](/docs/1.12/thermal-expansion-5/augments/) that
increases the maximum power output of a [dynamo](/docs/1.12/thermal-expansion-5/dynamos/), thereby
increasing its energy production speed.


Obtaining
---------

### Crafting
{% include recipe-table.html type='crafting' recipes=page.recipes.crafting no-result=true %}


Usage
-----

### Installation
An auxiliary transmission coil can be installed in the Augmentation tab in a
[dynamo](/docs/1.12/thermal-expansion-5/dynamos/)'s GUI. It can be installed multiple times, stacking its
effects.

### Effects
Installed auxiliary transmission coils increase a [dynamo](/docs/1.12/thermal-expansion-5/dynamos/)'s
maximum power output, thereby increasing its energy production speed.
