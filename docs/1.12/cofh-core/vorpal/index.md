**Vorpal** is an [enchantment](https://minecraft.wiki/w/Enchanting) that
gives [swords](https://minecraft.wiki/w/Sword),
[axes](https://minecraft.wiki/w/Axe) and
[sickles](../../thermal-foundation/sickles/) a chance to do greatly increased
damage and to drop mob or player
[heads](https://minecraft.wiki/w/Mob_head). Its maximum level is III.


Usage
-----

Vorpal can be applied to [swords](https://minecraft.wiki/w/Sword),
[axes](https://minecraft.wiki/w/Axe) and
[sickles](../../thermal-foundation/sickles/).

When a mob or player is hit with a Vorpal enchanted weapon, there is a chance of
the amount of damage dealt being multiplied by 5. When they are killed with
Vorpal, there is a chance of them dropping their
[head](https://minecraft.wiki/w/Head). These chances depend on the
enchantment level.

| Vorpal level | Increased damage chance | Head drop chance |
|---
| I | 5% | 20% |
| II | 10% | 40% |
| III | 15% | 60% |
