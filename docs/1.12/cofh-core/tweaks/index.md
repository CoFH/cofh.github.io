[CoFH Core](../) adds several **tweaks** to the game. Most of these are optional
and can be disabled.


Infinity bows without arrows
----------------------------

[Bows](https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Bow) enchanted with
[Infinity](https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Enchanting#Infinity) work even if
there are no [arrows](https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Arrow) in the user's
inventory.


Named mob death messages
------------------------

When a [mob](https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Mob) with a custom
[name](https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Name_Tag) dies, a death message is shown
in the chat as if it were a player. This is enabled by default.

Color blind textures
--------------------

If color blind textures are enabled, features that rely on color use different
textures for people with color blindness.

Disabling particles
-------------------

A configuration option is provided to completely disable all
[particles](https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Particles), even those that still
appear when the 'Particles' setting is set to 'Minimal'. This option is provided
to increase performance on starch-based platforms.
