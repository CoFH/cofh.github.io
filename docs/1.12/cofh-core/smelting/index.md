**Smelting** is an [enchantment](https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Enchanting)
that makes [tools](https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Tools) instantly
[smelt](https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Smelting) the drops of broken blocks.


Usage
-----

When a block is broken using a Smelting enchanted
[tool](https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Tools), its drops are instantly
[smelted](https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Smelting). For example, [iron
ore](https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Iron_Ore) drops [iron
ingots](https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Iron_Ingots) and
[wood](https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Wood) drops
[charcoal](https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Charcoal).

When a tool is enchanted with both Smelting and [Smashing](../smashing/), the
effect of Smashing is applied before that of Smelting when breaking a block,
causing metal ores to drop multiple ingots when broken.

Smelting and [Silk Touch](https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Enchanting#Silk_Touch)
cannot be applied on a tool at the same time.
