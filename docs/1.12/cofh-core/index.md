**CoFH Core** is a mod for Minecraft 1.12 that provides common functionality for
the mods of Team CoFH for that version of the game. It must be installed in
order for the mods to run.

Other than providing common functionality for the other mods, CoFH Core also
provides a set of useful [commands](commands/), some configurable [game
tweaks](tweaks/), a [friend list](friend-list/), and several new enchantments.
It also notifies players of updates for the CoFH mods.
