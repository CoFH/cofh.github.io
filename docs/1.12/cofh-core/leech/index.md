**Leech** is an [enchantment](https://minecraft.wiki/w/Enchanting) that
makes [swords](https://minecraft.wiki/w/Sword),
[axes](https://minecraft.wiki/w/Axe) and
[sickles](../../thermal-foundation/sickles/) heal their users when used to kill
a mob or player. Its maximum level is IV.


Usage
-----

Leech can be applied to [swords](https://minecraft.wiki/w/Sword),
[axes](https://minecraft.wiki/w/Axe) and
[sickles](../../thermal-foundation/sickles/).

When a mob or player is killed using a Leech enchanted weapon, some of the
user's health is instantly restored. The amount of health restored depends on
the enchantment level.

| Leech level | Health restored |
|---
| I | 1 (1/2 heart) |
| II | 2 (1 heart) |
| III | 3 (1 1/2 hearts) |
| IV | 4 (2 hearts) |
