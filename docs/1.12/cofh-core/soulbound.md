**Soulbound** is an [enchantment](https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Enchanting)
that prevents items from being dropped when a player dies. Its maximum level is
III.


Usage
-----

Soulbound can be applied to any item.

When a player dies with a Soulbound enchanted item in their inventory, the item
is not dropped and will still be in the player's inventory when they respawn.
When this happens, the level of the enchantment may be decreased by 1, or the
enchantment may be removed if it is already at the lowest level. The chances of
this happening depend on the enchantment level.

| Soulbound level | Level decrease chance |
|---
| I | 50% |
| II | 33% |
| III | 25% |
