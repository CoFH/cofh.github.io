**Smashing** is an [enchantment](https://minecraft.wiki/w/Enchanting)
that makes [pickaxes](https://minecraft.wiki/w/Pickaxe) and similar tools
instantly crush broken ore blocks into multiple piles of dust, similar to how a
[pulverizer](../../thermal-expansion/pulverizer/) processes ores.


Usage
-----

When an ore block is broken using a Smashing enchanted
[pickaxe](https://minecraft.wiki/w/Pickaxe) or similar tool, the ore is
instantly crushed into two piles of dust (three if the ore is from the
[Nether](https://minecraft.wiki/w/The_Nether) or the
[End](https://minecraft.wiki/w/The_End)). This only works with ore blocks
that drop themselves when broken. For example, [iron
ore](https://minecraft.wiki/w/Iron_Ore) drops two piles of [pulverized
iron](../../thermal-foundation/pulverized-iron/) and [copper
ore](../../thermal-foundation/copper-ore/) drops two piles of [pulverized
copper](../../thermal-foundation/pulverized-copper/).

When a tool is enchanted with both Smashing and [Smelting](../smelting/), the
effect of Smashing is applied before that of Smelting when breaking a block,
causing metal ores to drop multiple ingots when broken.

Smashing and [Silk Touch](https://minecraft.wiki/w/Silk_Touch)
cannot be applied on a tool at the same time.
