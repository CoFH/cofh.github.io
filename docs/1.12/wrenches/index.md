**Wrenches** are tools that can be used to configure, rotate or dismantle
compatible blocks.


List of wrenches
----------------

These are the wrenches added by the CoFH mods. Many mods add a type of wrench or
a similar item, some of which are compatible with the CoFH mods.

### Thermal Series
* [Crescent Hammer](/docs/1.12/thermal-foundation-2/crescent-hammer/)

### Redstone Arsenal
* [Flux-Infused OmniWrench](/docs/1.12/redstone-arsenal-2/flux-infused-omniwrench/)
* [Flux-Infused BattleWrench](/docs/1.12/redstone-arsenal-2/flux-infused-battlewrench/)


Usage
-----

The following applies to all the wrenches added by the CoFH mods, and may apply
to wrenches or similar items added by other mods.

### Configuring and rotating
When used on a block, a wrench will attempt to either configure it, or rotate
it. What 'configuring' a block means depends on the type of block.

### Dismantling
When used on a compatible block while the user is sneaking, a wrench will
attempt to dismantle it. When dismantled, a block is instantly dropped as an
item.

Most blocks in [Thermal Expansion](/docs/1.12/thermal-expansion-5/) and [Thermal
Dynamics](/docs/1.12/thermal-dynamics-2/) can be dismantled, as well as [hardened
glass](/docs/1.12/thermal-foundation-2/hardened-glass/).
