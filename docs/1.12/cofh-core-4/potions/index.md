[CoFH Core](/docs/1.12/cofh-core-4/) adds several new
[potions](https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Potion) to the game, along with
stronger versions of some existing potions.


New potions
-----------

Several new potions are added, all of which apply
[effects](https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Status_effects) that do not have
corresponding potions in the base game. [Thermal
Foundation](/docs/1.12/thermal-foundation-2/) adds [recipes](/docs/1.12/thermal-foundation-2/potion-recipes/)
to obtain these potions.

Stronger potions
----------------

The following potions gain additional stronger levels: III and IV. Their
extended versions (brewed using
[redstone](https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Redstone)) also gain stronger levels:
II and III. When [Thermal Expansion](/docs/1.12/thermal-expansion-5/) is installed,
these can be obtained using an [alchemical
retort](/docs/1.12/thermal-expansion-5/augment-alchemical-retort/).
