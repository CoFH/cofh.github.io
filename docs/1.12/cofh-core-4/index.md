**CoFH Core 4** is a mod for Minecraft 1.12 that provides common functionality
for the mods of Team CoFH for that version of the game. It must be installed in
order for the mods to run.

Other than providing common functionality for the other mods, CoFH Core also
provides a set of useful [commands](/docs/1.12/cofh-core-4/commands/), some
configurable [game tweaks](/docs/1.12/cofh-core-4/tweaks/), a [friend
list](/docs/1.12/cofh-core-4/friend-list/), and several new enchantments. It also
notifies players of updates for the CoFH mods.
