Potions of misfortune and decay can be brewed by adding [fermented spider
eyes](https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Fermented_Spider_Eye) to potions of luck
and regeneration, respectively.

Like with other potions, [redstone](https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Redstone)
and [glowstone dust](https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Glowstone_Dust) can be used
to extend the duration and increase the strength of these potions.
