**Oil shale** is an uncommon [ore](https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Ore) that
yields [bitumen](/docs/1.12/thermal-foundation-2/bitumen/) ([crude oil](/docs/1.12/thermal-foundation-2/crude-oil/)) and small
amounts of [flint](https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Flint).


Obtaining
---------

Oil shale occurs fairly uncommonly in
[mesas](https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Mesa),
[oceans](https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Ocean),
[swamplands](https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Swampland), and snowy
[biomes](https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Biome) in veins between
[gravel](https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Gravel),
[dirt](https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Dirt) and
[stone](https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Stone) blocks. It is found at almost any
altitude (layers 10-80). It occurs in fairly large deposits, almost as large as
deposits of [coal ore](https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Coal_Ore). Deposits of
oil shale may also contain some coal ore.

Oil shale also more rarely occurs in much larger deposits underground (layers
20-60) in all biomes, surrounding a small amount of [crude
oil](/docs/1.12/thermal-foundation-2/crude-oil/).

Oil shale must be mined with a [stone
pickaxe](https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Stone_Pickaxe) or
[shovel](https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Stone_Shovel) or better. It drops one
piece of [bitumen](/docs/1.12/thermal-foundation-2/bitumen/) when mined. More bitumen is dropped if a
[Fortune](https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Fortune) enchanted tool is used. Oil
shale itself can be obtained by mining it with a [Silk
Touch](https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Silk_Touch) enchanted tool.

When oil shale is broken, some [crude oil](/docs/1.12/thermal-foundation-2/crude-oil/) comes flowing out.
This oil cannot be picked up and eventually disappears. If a Silk Touch
enchanted tool is used, no fluid comes flowing out.

Trivia
------

* Oil shale is generated in the world using [CoFH World](/docs/1.12/cofh-world/) by
  default. The world generation can be tweaked or disabled using CoFH World's
  [configuration](/docs/1.12/cofh-world/world-generator-configuration/).
