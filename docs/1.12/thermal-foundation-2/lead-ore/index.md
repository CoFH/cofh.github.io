![Lead ore](/assets/images/thermal-foundation-2/ore-lead.png){:style="height: 128px"}


**Lead ore** is a somewhat uncommon [ore](https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Ore)
that yields [lead](/docs/1.12/thermal-foundation-2/lead-ingot/) and small amounts of
[silver](/docs/1.12/thermal-foundation-2/silver-ingot/).


Obtaining
---------

Lead ore is less common than [iron
ore](https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Iron_Ore), but more common than [gold
ore](https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Gold_Ore). It occurs at relatively low
levels in the world (layers 15-35). Lead ore veins are slightly smaller than
iron ore veins, and may contain one or two blocks of [silver
ore](/docs/1.12/thermal-foundation-2/silver-ore/) as well. Similarly, silver ore veins may contain one or
two blocks of lead ore.

Lead ore must be mined with an [iron
pickaxe](https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Pickaxe) or better. If it is mined, it
drops itself as an item.


Usage
-----

### Smelting
{% include recipe-table.html type='smelting' recipes=page.usage-recipes.smelting %}

### Crafting
{% include recipe-table.html type='crafting' recipes=page.usage-recipes.crafting %}

### Pulverizer
{% include recipe-table.html type='te5-pulverizer' recipes=page.usage-recipes.pulverizer %}

### Induction Smelter
{% include recipe-table.html type='te5-smelter' recipes=page.usage-recipes.smelter %}

### Smashing
When lead ore is broken using a [Smashing](/docs/1.12/cofh-core-4/smashing/) enchanted
[pickaxe](https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Pickaxe) or similar tool, two piles of
[pulverized lead](/docs/1.12/thermal-foundation-2/pulverized-lead/) are dropped instead
of the ore.


Trivia
------

* Lead ore is generated in the world using [CoFH World](/docs/1.12/cofh-world/) by
  default. The world generation can be tweaked or disabled using CoFH World's
  [configuration](/docs/1.12/cofh-world/world-generator-configuration/).
