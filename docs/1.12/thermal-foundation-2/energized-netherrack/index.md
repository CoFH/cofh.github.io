**Energized netherrack** is a rare [ore](https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Ore)
that yields [energized clathrate](/docs/1.12/thermal-foundation-2/energized-clathrate/) ([energized
glowstone](/docs/1.12/thermal-foundation-2/energized-glowstone/)) and small amounts of
[sulfur](/docs/1.12/thermal-foundation-2/sulfur/). It can be found in the
[Nether](https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/The_Nether).


Obtaining
---------

Energized netherrack occurs rarely in the lower levels of the Nether (layers
10-40). It occurs in fairly large deposits, about as large as deposits of [coal
ore](https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Coal_Ore). Deposits of energized netherrack
may also contain some [energized glowstone](/docs/1.12/thermal-foundation-2/energized-glowstone/).

Energized netherrack must be mined with a [stone
pickaxe](https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Pickaxe) or better. It drops one piece
of [energized clathrate](/docs/1.12/thermal-foundation-2/energized-clathrate/) when mined. More clathrate
is dropped if a [Fortune](https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Fortune) enchanted
pickaxe is used. The ore block itself can be obtained by mining it with a [Silk
Touch](https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Silk_Touch) enchanted pickaxe.

When energized netherrack is broken, some [energized
glowstone](/docs/1.12/thermal-foundation-2/energized-glowstone/) comes flowing out. This fluid cannot be
picked up and eventually disappears. If a Silk Touch enchanted pickaxe is used,
no fluid comes flowing out.

Trivia
------

* Energized netherrack is generated in the world using [CoFH
  World](/docs/1.12/cofh-world/) by default. The world generation can be tweaked or
  disabled using CoFH World's
  [configuration](/docs/1.12/cofh-world/world-generator-configuration/).
