**Seed oil** is a fluid obtained from various kinds of seeds. It can be used to
turn [pulped biomass](/docs/1.12/thermal-foundation-2/pulped-biomass/) into [rich
biomass](/docs/1.12/thermal-foundation-2/rich-biomass/) and [pulped
bioblend](/docs/1.12/thermal-foundation-2/pulped-bioblend/) into [rich
bioblend](/docs/1.12/thermal-foundation-2/rich-bioblend/). It can also be used as fuel
in a [compression dynamo](/docs/1.12/thermal-expansion-5/compression-dynamo/).


Obtaining
---------

### Fluid Transposer

Usage
-----

Seed oil cannot be placed as a block.

### Fluid Transposer ingredient
{% include recipe-table.html type='te5-transposer-fill' recipes=page.usage-recipes.transposer-fill %}

### Compression Dynamo fuel
When used as fuel in a [compression
dynamo](/docs/1.12/thermal-expansion-5/compression-dynamo/), a bucket of seed oil
yields 80,000 RF.
