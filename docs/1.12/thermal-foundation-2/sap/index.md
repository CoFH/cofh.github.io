**Sap** is a fluid obtained from oak and dark oak
[trees](https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Tree). It can be used to turn [regular
Phyto-Gro](/docs/1.12/thermal-foundation-2/phyto-gro/) into [rich Phyto-Gro](/docs/1.12/thermal-foundation-2/rich-phyto-gro/).


Obtaining
---------

### Arboreal Extractor
An [arboreal extractor](/docs/1.12/thermal-expansion-5/arboreal-extractor/) will
produce sap when placed next to an oak or dark oak
[tree](https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Tree). Dark oak trees produce twice as
much sap as oak trees.

### Sawmill with Resin Funnel
A [sawmill](/docs/1.12/thermal-expansion-5/sawmill/) with a [resin
funnel](/docs/1.12/thermal-expansion-5/augment-resin-funnel/) installed produces sap as
a byproduct when processing oak or dark oak
[wood](https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Wood). Dark oak wood yields twice as much
sap as oak wood.
