**Thermal Foundation 2** is a mod for Minecraft 1.12. It adds basic materials
and tools that are used by the other "Thermal" mods for that version of the
game. It also adds basic tools, weapons and armor made of the various new
materials.

When Thermal Foundation 2 is installed, several new features such as ores are
generated in the world using [CoFH World](/docs/1.12/cofh-world/). This world
generation can be tweaked or disabled using CoFH World's
[configuration](/docs/1.12/cofh-world/world-generator-configuration/).
