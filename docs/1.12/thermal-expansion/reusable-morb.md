title: Reusable Morb
---

A **reusable morb** is a [morb](../morb/) that never breaks.


Obtaining
---------

### Crafting
{% include docs/recipe/table/table.html recipe-type='crafting-shapeless' recipe-ids=page.recipes.crafting-shapeless no-result=true %}


Usage
-----

A reusable morb works like a regular [morb](../morb/), except it doesn't
break after releasing a contained [mob](https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Mob).

### Centrifugal Separator with Enstabulation Apparatus
When processing filled reusable morbs using a [centrifugal
separator](../centrifugal-separator/) with an
[enstabulation
apparatus](../augment-enstabulation-apparatus/) installed,
the empty morbs are always returned as an output.
