In [Thermal Expansion](../), certain fluids are registered
as **coolants**. They may be used when generating or consuming [Redstone
Flux](/docs/redstone-flux/).


Usage
-----

Coolants are used by [compression dynamos](../compression-dynamo/), [magmatic
dynamos](../magmatic-dynamo/) with [isentropic
reservoirs](../augment-isentropic-reservoir/) installed and [thermal
mediators](../thermal-mediator/).

Every coolant has a thermal capacity (TC), which specifies for how long a
certain amount of it is effective before being consumed, and a coolant factor,
which specifies how effective it is.

| Fluid | Thermal capacity (1,000 mB) | Coolant factor |
|---
| [Water](https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Water) | 250,000 TC | 20% |
| [Gelid Cryotheum](../../thermal-foundation/gelid-cryotheum/) | 3,000,000 TC | 60% |
| Crushed Ice ([Forestry](https://forestryforminecraft.info/)) | 1,500,000 TC | 40% |
| Distilled Water ([IndustrialCraft²](https://www.industrial-craft.net/)) | 300,000 TC | 30% |
| Coolant ([IndustrialCraft²](https://www.industrial-craft.net/)) | 2,000,000 TC | 50% |
