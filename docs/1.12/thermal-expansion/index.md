**Thermal Expansion** is a mod for Minecraft 1.12. It adds blocks for automating
various tasks, processing items and fluids, generating [Redstone
Flux](/docs/redstone-flux/), and for storing items, fluids and energy. It also
adds orbs that can be thrown to release fluids, or to capture or release mobs.
