A **fuel catalyzer** is an [augment](../augments/) that increases the amount
of energy a [dynamo](../dynamos/) generates from each unit of fuel.


Obtaining
---------

### Crafting
{% include recipe-table.html type='crafting' recipes=page.recipes.crafting no-result=true %}


Usage
-----

### Installation
A fuel catalyzer can be installed in the Augmentation tab in a
[dynamo](../dynamos/)'s GUI. It can be installed multiple times, stacking its
effects.

### Effects
Installed fuel catalyzers increase the amount of energy a
[dynamo](../dynamos/) generates from each unit of fuel.

| Installed amount | Energy increase |
|---
| 1 | + 15% |
| 2 | + 30% |
| 3 | + 45% |
| 4 | + 60% |
| 5 | + 75% |
| 6 | + 90% |
| 7 | + 105% |
| 8 | + 120% |

</div>
{::options parse_block_html="false" /}

If fuel catalyzers are installed together with other augments that affect the
amount of energy generated from each unit of fuel, their energy
increase/decrease percentages are added together before being applied to the
amount of energy.
