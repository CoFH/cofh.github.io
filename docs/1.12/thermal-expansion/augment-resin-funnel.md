title: 'Augment: Resin Funnel'
---

A **resin funnel** is an [augment](../augments/) that allows for a
[sawmill](../sawmill/) to extract fluids from
[wood](https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Wood), like an [arboreal
extractor](../arboreal-extractor/) does with
[trees](https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Tree).


Obtaining
---------

### Crafting
{% include docs/recipe/table/table.html recipe-type='crafting-shaped' recipe-ids=page.recipes.crafting-shaped no-result=true %}


Usage
-----

### Installation
A resin funnel can be installed in the Augmentation tab in a
[sawmill](../sawmill/)'s GUI. It is a specialization that cannot be installed
together with other specialization augments.

### Effects
A [sawmill](../sawmill/) with a resin funnel installed produces a fluid
byproduct when processing [wood](https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Wood). It
produces the same [fluids](../arboreal-extractor/#products) that an [arboreal
extractor](../arboreal-extractor/) extracts from the corresponding types of
[trees](https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Tree). The amount of fluid produced per
unit of wood is equal to the amount of fluid an arboreal extractor produces per
cycle divided by 5.

An installed resin funnel increases the amount of energy required per operation
by 50%.

If a resin funnel is installed together with other augments that increase the
amount of energy required per operation, their energy increase percentages are
added together before being applied to the amount of energy.
