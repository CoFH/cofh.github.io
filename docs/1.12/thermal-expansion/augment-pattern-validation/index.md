A **pattern validation** [augment](../augments/) allows for a [sequential
fabricator](../sequential-fabricator/) to handle item input more
intelligently.


Obtaining
---------

### Crafting
{% include recipe-table.html type='crafting' recipes=page.recipes.crafting no-result=true %}


Usage
-----

### Installation
A pattern validation augment can be installed in the Augmentation tab in a
[sequential fabricator](../sequential-fabricator/)'s GUI.

### Effects
An installed pattern validation augment allows for a [sequential
fabricator](../sequential-fabricator/) to handle item input more
intelligently. It also allows
[auto-input](../sequential-fabricator/#input-and-output) to be enabled.

When pattern validation is installed, two of the machine's input slots are
designated for each crafting slot. This prevents the input slots from getting
clogged with a certain item when other items are also required.
