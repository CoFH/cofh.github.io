title: 'Augment: Transmission Coil Ducting'
---

**Transmission coil ducting** is an [augment](../augments/) that allows items
and fluids to enter a [dynamo](../dynamos/) through its coil, which can
normally only emit [Redstone Flux](/docs/redstone-flux/).


Obtaining
---------

### Crafting
{% include docs/recipe/table/table.html recipe-type='crafting-shaped' recipe-ids=page.recipes.crafting-shaped no-result=true %}


Usage
-----

### Installation
Transmission coil ducting can be installed in the Augmentation tab in a
[dynamo](../dynamos/)'s GUI.

### Effects
Installed transmission coil ducting allows for a [dynamo](../dynamos/) to
receive items and fluids through its coil, which is the side that emits
[Redstone Flux](/docs/redstone-flux/). Dynamos can normally only receive items
and fluids through the other sides.
