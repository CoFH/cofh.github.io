title: 'Augment: Parabolic Flux Coupling'
---

A **parabolic flux coupling** [augment](../augments/) allows for an
[energetic infuser](../energetic-infuser/) to wirelessly recharge [flux
capacitors](../flux-capacitor/) of players within a radius of 32 blocks.


Obtaining
---------

### Crafting
{% include docs/recipe/table/table.html recipe-type='crafting-shaped' recipe-ids=page.recipes.crafting-shaped no-result=true %}


Usage
-----

### Installation
A parabolic flux coupling augment can be installed in the Augmentation tab in an
[energetic infuser](../energetic-infuser/)'s GUI. It is a specialization that
cannot be installed together with other specialization augments.

### Effects
An [energetic infuser](../energetic-infuser/) with parabolic flux coupling
installed will wirelessly recharge [flux capacitors](../flux-capacitor/) in
the inventories of players within a radius of 32 blocks. However, the machine
can no longer charge or process items that are supplied to it directly.

An energetic infuser with parabolic flux coupling installed can charge the flux
capacitors of multiple players simultaneously, but only charges one flux
capacitor at a time for each player.

Parabolic flux coupling also greatly increases an energetic infuser's maximum
charging rate.
