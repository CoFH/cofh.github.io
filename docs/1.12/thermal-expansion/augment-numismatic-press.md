title: 'Augment: Numismatic Press'
---

A **numismatic press** is an [augment](../augments/) that allows for a
[compactor](../compactor/) to produce metal coins instead of plates.


Obtaining
---------

### Crafting
{% include docs/recipe/table/table.html recipe-type='crafting-shaped' recipe-ids=page.recipes.crafting-shaped no-result=true %}


Usage
-----

### Installation
A numismatic press can be installed in the Augmentation tab in a
[compactor](../compactor/)'s GUI. It is a specialization that cannot be
installed together with other specialization augments.

### Effects
An installed numismatic press allows for a [compactor](../compactor/) to
produce metal coins from ingots. This replaces the machine's ability to produce
metal plates.
