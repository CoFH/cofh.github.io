title: 'Augment: Auxiliary Transmission Coil'
---

An **auxiliary transmission coil** is an [augment](../augments/) that
increases the maximum power output of a [dynamo](../dynamos/), thereby
increasing its energy production speed.


Obtaining
---------

### Crafting
{% include docs/recipe/table/table.html recipe-type='crafting-shaped' recipe-ids=page.recipes.crafting-shaped no-result=true %}


Usage
-----

### Installation
An auxiliary transmission coil can be installed in the Augmentation tab in a
[dynamo](../dynamos/)'s GUI. It can be installed multiple times, stacking its
effects.

### Effects
Installed auxiliary transmission coils increase a [dynamo](../dynamos/)'s
maximum power output, thereby increasing its energy production speed.
