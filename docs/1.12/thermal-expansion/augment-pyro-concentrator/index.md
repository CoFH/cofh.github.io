A **pyro-concentrator** is an [augment](../augments/) that allows for an
[induction smelter](../induction-smelter/) to process
[ores](../induction-smelter/#ore-processing) more efficiently using [blazing
pyrotheum](../../thermal-foundation/blazing-pyrotheum/).

### Crafting

Usage
-----

### Installation
A pyro-concentrator can be installed in the Augmentation tab in an [induction
smelter](../induction-smelter/)'s GUI. It is a specialization that cannot be
installed together with other specialization augments.

### Effects
An [induction smelter](../induction-smelter/) with a pyro-concentrator
installed produces 1.5 times as much of the primary product of any
[ore](../induction-smelter/#ore-processing) it processes. However, it
consumes 100 mB of [blazing pyrotheum](../../thermal-foundation/blazing-pyrotheum/) per ore to do
so, and the amount of energy required per operation is increased by 50%.

An installed pyro-concentrator also increases the chances of an induction
smelter producing a secondary product. This effect stacks with those of any
installed [auxiliary sieves](../augment-auxiliary-sieve/).

<!--
modifiedChance = 100 - amount * 15 - 30   (minimum is 5)
multiplier = 100 / modifiedChance

If a pyro-concentrator is installed together with other augments that increase
the amount of energy required per operation, their energy increase percentages
are added together before being applied to the amount of energy.
