**Flux-infused boots** are powerful
[boots](https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Boots) powered by [Redstone
Flux](/docs/redstone-flux/).


Obtaining
---------

### Crafting
{% include recipe-table.html type='crafting' recipes=page.recipes.crafting no-result=true %}


Usage
-----

### Charging
Flux-infused boots can hold up to 800,000 [RF](/docs/redstone-flux/). They can
be charged using an [energetic infuser](/docs/1.12/thermal-expansion/energetic-infuser/), a [flux
capacitor](/docs/1.12/thermal-expansion/flux-capacitor/) or similar. They can also be charged by
touching a [fluxed electrum block](/docs/1.12/redstone-arsenal/fluxed-electrum-block/) or [flux
crystal block](/docs/1.12/redstone-arsenal/flux-crystal-block) while holding them. They can be charged
at rates up to 4,000 RF/t.

### Defense
Charged flux-infused boots offer the same protection as [diamond
boots](https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Diamond_Boots). Instead of taking damage,
flux-infused boots consume 200 RF per damage point per hit.

When hit with flux damage (a special type of damage dealt by flux-infused
weapons), flux-infused boots are charged with energy instead of consuming it.

### Enchantments
Flux-infused boots have an
[enchantability](https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Enchantability) of 20, which is
slightly lower than that of [golden
boots](https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Golden_Boots). They can receive all the
enchantments that other boots can receive.

When enchanted with [Unbreaking](https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Unbreaking),
flux-infused boots have a chance to not consume [Redstone
Flux](/docs/redstone-flux/) when absorbing damage.

| Unbreaking level | No energy use chance |
|---
| I | 40% |
| II | 50% |
| III | 57% |

Flux-infused boots can also be enchanted with [Holding](/docs/1.12/cofh-core/holding/) to
increase their energy capacity.

| Holding level | Capacity multiplier |
|---
| I | × 1.5 |
| II | × 2 |
| III | × 2.5 |
| IV | × 3 |
