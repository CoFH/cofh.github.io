A **flux-infused excavator** is a powerful
[excavator](../../thermal-foundation/excavators/) powered by [Redstone
Flux](/docs/redstone-flux/).


Obtaining
---------

### Crafting
{% include recipe-table.html type='crafting' recipes=page.recipes.crafting no-result=true %}


Usage
-----

### Charging
A flux-infused excavator can hold up to 320,000 [RF](/docs/redstone-flux/).
It can be charged using an [energetic
infuser](../../thermal-expansion/energetic-infuser/), a [flux
capacitor](../../thermal-expansion/flux-capacitor/) or similar. It can also be
charged by touching a [fluxed electrum block](../fluxed-electrum-block/) or
[flux crystal block](../flux-crystal-block) while holding it. It can be charged
at rates up to 4,000 RF/t.

An uncharged flux-infused excavator is still usable and will not break when
used, but it is much less powerful.

### Empowering
A charged flux-infused excavator can be empowered, increasing its power. This
can be toggled by pressing "Cycle Item Mode" (V by default).

### Mining
An uncharged flux-infused excavator has a very low digging speed (even slower
than a [wooden shovel](https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Wooden_Shovel)) and can
only break one block at a time. When charged, it has the same digging speed as a
[diamond excavator](../../thermal-foundation/excavators/), breaks up to 9 blocks
at a time in a 3x3 area, and consumes 200 RF per use. When empowered, it is 1.5
times as fast as a diamond excavator, breaks up to 25 blocks at a time in a 5x5
area, and consumes 1,600 RF per use.

When sneaking, a flux-infused excavator breaks only one block at a time.

### Weapon
An uncharged flux-infused excavator has an attack speed of 1, and deals 2
damage. When charged, it deals 5 damage as well as 1 flux damage (a special type
of damage that bypasses armor). When empowered, its attack speed is raised to
1.4 and its flux damage is raised to 4.

### Enchantments
A flux-infused excavator has an
[enchantability](https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Enchantability) of 25, which is
slightly higher than that of a [golden
excavator](../../thermal-foundation/excavators/). It can receive all the
enchantments that other excavators can receive.

When enchanted with [Unbreaking](https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Unbreaking), a
flux-infused excavator has a chance to not consume [Redstone
Flux](/docs/redstone-flux/) when used.

| Unbreaking level | No energy use chance |
|---
| I | 33% |
| II | 50% |
| III | 60% |

A flux-infused excavator can also be enchanted with
[Holding](../../cofh-core/holding/) to increase its energy capacity.

| Holding level | Capacity multiplier |
|---
| I | × 1.5 |
| II | × 2 |
| III | × 2.5 |
| IV | × 3 |
