A **flux-infused bow** is a powerful [bow](https://minecraft.wiki/w/Bow)
powered by [Redstone Flux](/docs/redstone-flux/).


Obtaining
---------

### Crafting
{% include recipe-table.html type='crafting' recipes=page.recipes.crafting no-result=true %}


Usage
-----

### Charging
A flux-infused bow can hold up to 320,000 [RF](/docs/redstone-flux/). It can
be charged using an [energetic
infuser](../../thermal-expansion/energetic-infuser/), a [flux
capacitor](../../thermal-expansion/flux-capacitor/) or similar. It can also be
charged by touching a [fluxed electrum block](../fluxed-electrum-block/) or
[flux crystal block](../flux-crystal-block) while holding it. It can be charged
at rates up to 4,000 RF/t.

### Empowering
A charged flux-infused bow can be empowered, increasing its power. This can be
toggled by pressing "Cycle Item Mode" (V by default).

### Weapon
Like a regular [bow](https://minecraft.wiki/w/Bow), a flux-infused bow
can be used to fire [arrows](https://minecraft.wiki/w/Arrow). It has an
arrow damage multiplier of 0.5, an arrow speed multiplier of 1.5, and consumes
200 RF per use. When empowered, it has an arrow damage multiplier of 1.25, an
arrow speed multiplier of 1.6, and consumes 800 RF per use.

### Enchantments
A flux-infused bow has an
[enchantability](https://minecraft.wiki/w/Enchantability) of 25, which is
much higher than that of a regular [bow](https://minecraft.wiki/w/Bow).

When enchanted with [Unbreaking](https://minecraft.wiki/w/Unbreaking), a
flux-infused bow has a chance to not consume [Redstone
Flux](/docs/redstone-flux/) when used.

| Unbreaking level | No energy use chance |
|---
| I | 33% |
| II | 50% |
| III | 60% |

A flux-infused bow can also be enchanted with
[Holding](../../cofh-core/holding/) to increase its energy capacity.

| Holding level | Capacity multiplier |
|---
| I | × 1.5 |
| II | × 2 |
| III | × 2.5 |
| IV | × 3 |
