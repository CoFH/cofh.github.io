A **flux-infused sword** is a powerful
[sword](https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Sword) powered by [Redstone
Flux](../../../redstone-flux/).


Obtaining
---------

### Crafting
{% include recipe-table.html type='crafting' recipes=page.recipes.crafting no-result=true %}


Usage
-----

### Charging
A flux-infused sword can hold up to 320,000 [RF](../../../redstone-flux/). It can
be charged using an [energetic infuser](../../thermal-expansion/energetic-infuser/), a [flux
capacitor](../../thermal-expansion/flux-capacitor/) or similar. It can also be charged by touching
a [fluxed electrum block](../fluxed-electrum-block/) or [flux crystal
block](../flux-crystal-block) while holding it. It can be charged at rates up
to 4,000 RF/t.

An uncharged flux-infused sword is still usable and will not break when used,
but it is much less powerful.

### Empowering
A charged flux-infused sword can be empowered, increasing its power. This can
be toggled by pressing "Cycle Item Mode" (V by default).

### Weapon
An uncharged flux-infused sword has an attack speed of 1.6, and deals 2 damage.
When charged, it deals 6 damage as well as 1 flux damage (a special type of
damage that bypasses armor), and consumes 200 RF per use. When empowered, its
attack speed is raised to 2, its flux damage is raised to 10, and it consumes
800 RF per use.

### Enchantments
A flux-infused sword has an
[enchantability](https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Enchantability) of 25, which is
slightly higher than that of a [golden
sword](https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Golden_Sword). It can receive all the
enchantments that other swords can receive.

When enchanted with [Unbreaking](https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Unbreaking), a
flux-infused sword has a chance to not consume [Redstone
Flux](../../../redstone-flux/) when used.

| Unbreaking level | No energy use chance |
|---
| I | 33% |
| II | 50% |
| III | 60% |

A flux-infused sword can also be enchanted with [Holding](../../cofh-core/holding/) to
increase its energy capacity.

| Holding level | Capacity multiplier |
|---
| I | × 1.5 |
| II | × 2 |
| III | × 2.5 |
| IV | × 3 |
