**Fluxed electrum ingots** are raw materials made from
[electrum](../../thermal-foundation/electrum-ingot/) and [destabilized
redstone](../../thermal-foundation/destabilized-redstone/).


Obtaining
---------

Fluxed electrum is an advanced alloy that can be obtained by crafting [fluxed
electrum blend](../fluxed-electrum-blend/). The blend can only be smelted
into ingots in an [induction smelter](../../thermal-expansion/induction-smelter/).
