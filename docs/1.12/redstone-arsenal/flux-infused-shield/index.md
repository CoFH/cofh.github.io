A **flux-infused shield** is a powerful
[shield](https://minecraft.wiki/w/Shield) powered by [Redstone
Flux](/docs/redstone-flux/).


Obtaining
---------

### Crafting
{% include recipe-table.html type='crafting' recipes=page.recipes.crafting no-result=true %}


Usage
-----

### Charging
A flux-infused shield can hold up to 320,000 [RF](/docs/redstone-flux/). It can
be charged using an [energetic infuser](../../thermal-expansion/energetic-infuser/), a [flux
capacitor](../../thermal-expansion/flux-capacitor/) or similar. It can also be charged by touching
a [fluxed electrum block](../fluxed-electrum-block/) or [flux crystal
block](../flux-crystal-block) while holding it. It can be charged at rates up
to 4,000 RF/t.

An uncharged flux-infused shield is still usable and will not break when used,
but it is much less powerful.

### Empowering
A charged flux-infused shield can be empowered, increasing its power. This can
be toggled by pressing "Cycle Item Mode" (V by default).

### Defense
When a flux-infused shield is used to
[block](https://minecraft.wiki/w/Blocking) an incoming attack, the shield
deals 1 flux damage (a special type of damage that bypasses armor) to the
attacker. It consumes 200 RF per blocked attack. When empowered, it deals 6 flux
damage and consumes 800 RF per blocked attack.

### Weapon
When used as a weapon, a flux-infused shield deals 1 flux damage and consumes
200 RF per hit. When empowered, it deals 6 flux damage and consumes 800 RF per
hit.

### Enchantments
A flux-infused shield has an
[enchantability](https://minecraft.wiki/w/Enchantability) of 25. It can
receive all the enchantments that a regular
[shield](https://minecraft.wiki/w/Shield) can receive.

When enchanted with [Unbreaking](https://minecraft.wiki/w/Unbreaking), a
flux-infused shield has a chance to not consume [Redstone
Flux](/docs/redstone-flux/) when used.

| Unbreaking level | No energy use chance |
|---
| I | 33% |
| II | 50% |
| III | 60% |

A flux-infused shield can also be enchanted with [Holding](../../cofh-core/holding/) to
increase its energy capacity.

| Holding level | Capacity multiplier |
|---
| I | × 1.5 |
| II | × 2 |
| III | × 2.5 |
| IV | × 3 |
