**Vanilla+ Satchels** is a mod for Minecraft 1.12. It adds
[satchels](/docs/1.12/vanillaplus-satchels/satchel/): items that store other
items, and are able to automatically store picked up items. They are
functionally identical to the [satchels](/docs/1.12/thermal-expansion/satchel/)
provided by [Thermal Expansion 5](/docs/1.12/thermal-expansion/), but are made
of materials that are available in the base game.
