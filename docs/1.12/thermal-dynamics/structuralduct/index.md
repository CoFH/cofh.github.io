A **structuralduct** is a decorative block that connects to most other ducts. It
is most commonly used to craft [covers](/docs/1.12/thermal-dynamics/covers/).


Obtaining
---------

A placed structuralduct can be instantly picked up by dismantling it with a
[wrench](/docs/1.12/wrenches/). It can also be mined using a
[pickaxe](https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Pickaxe).

Usage

### Placement
When placed, a structuralduct connects to any adjacent ducts of the same width.
Any connected side of a structuralduct can be disconnected and reconnected by
using a [wrench](/docs/1.12/wrenches/) on it.
