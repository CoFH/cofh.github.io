A **flux-infused shovel** is a powerful
[shovel](https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Shovel) powered by [Redstone
Flux](/docs/redstone-flux/). It also serves as a
[hoe](https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Hoe).


Obtaining
---------

### Crafting
{% include recipe-table.html type='crafting' recipes=page.recipes.crafting no-result=true %}


Usage
-----

### Charging
A flux-infused shovel can hold up to 320,000 [RF](/docs/redstone-flux/). It can
be charged using an [energetic infuser](/docs/1.12/thermal-expansion-5/energetic-infuser/), a [flux
capacitor](/docs/1.12/thermal-expansion-5/flux-capacitor/) or similar. It can also be charged by touching
a [fluxed electrum block](/docs/1.12/redstone-arsenal-2/fluxed-electrum-block/) or [flux crystal
block](/docs/1.12/redstone-arsenal-2/flux-crystal-block) while holding it. It can be charged at rates up
to 4,000 RF/t.

An uncharged flux-infused shovel is still usable and will not break when used,
but it is much less powerful.

### Empowering
A charged flux-infused shovel can be empowered, increasing its power. This can
be toggled by pressing "Cycle Item Mode" (V by default).

### Digging
An uncharged flux-infused shovel has a very low digging speed: half the speed of
a [wooden shovel](https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Wooden_Shovel). When charged,
it has the same digging speed as a [diamond
shovel](https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Diamond_Shovel), and consumes 200 RF per
use. When empowered, it is 1.5 times as fast as a diamond shovel, and consumes
800 RF per use.

When a block is broken using an empowered flux-infused shovel, up to 4 blocks in
a row behind the broken block are also broken if possible.

### Grass paths
Like a regular [shovel](https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Shovel), a charged
flux-infused shovel can be used to create [grass
paths](https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Grass_Path).

When a grass path is created using an empowered flux-infused shovel, up to 4
more grass paths are created in a row behind the created path if possible.

### Tilling
A charged flux-infused shovel can serve as a
[hoe](https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Hoe) by using it while sneaking.

When a block is tilled using an empowered flux-infused shovel, up to 4 blocks in
a row behind the tilled block are also tilled if possible.

### Weapon
An uncharged flux-infused shovel has an attack speed of 1, and deals 2 damage.
When charged, it deals 5 damage as well as 1 flux damage (a special type of
damage that bypasses armor). When empowered, its attack speed is raised to 1.4
and its flux damage is raised to 4.

### Enchantments
A flux-infused shovel has an
[enchantability](https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Enchantability) of 25, which is
slightly higher than that of a [golden
shovel](https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Golden_Shovel). It can receive all the
enchantments that other shovels can receive.

When enchanted with [Unbreaking](https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Unbreaking), a
flux-infused shovel has a chance to not consume [Redstone
Flux](/docs/redstone-flux/) when used.

| Unbreaking level | No energy use chance |
|---
| I | 33% |
| II | 50% |
| III | 60% |

A flux-infused shovel can also be enchanted with [Holding](/docs/1.12/cofh-core-4/holding/) to
increase its energy capacity.

| Holding level | Capacity multiplier |
|---
| I | × 1.5 |
| II | × 2 |
| III | × 2.5 |
| IV | × 3 |
