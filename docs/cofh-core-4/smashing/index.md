**Smashing** is an [enchantment](https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Enchanting)
that makes [pickaxes](https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Pickaxe) and similar tools
instantly crush broken ore blocks into multiple piles of dust, similar to how a
[pulverizer](/docs/thermal-expansion/) processes ores.


Usage
-----

When an ore block is broken using a Smashing enchanted
[pickaxe](https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Pickaxe) or similar tool, the ore is
instantly crushed into two piles of dust (three if the ore is from the
[Nether](https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/The_Nether) or the
[End](https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/The_End)). This only works with ore blocks
that drop themselves when broken. For example, [iron
ore](https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Iron_Ore) drops two piles of [pulverized
iron](/docs/thermal-foundation-2/pulverized-iron/) and [copper
ore](/docs/thermal-foundation-2/copper-ore/) drops two piles of [pulverized
copper](/docs/thermal-foundation-2/pulverized-copper/).

When a tool is enchanted with both Smashing and
[Smelting](/docs/cofh-core-4/smelting/), the effect of Smashing is applied before
that of Smelting when breaking a block, causing metal ores to drop multiple
ingots when broken.

Smashing and [Silk Touch](https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Enchanting#Silk_Touch)
cannot be applied on a tool at the same time.
