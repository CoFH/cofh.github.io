A **permafrost compressor** is an [augment](/docs/augments/) that allows for a
[glacial precipitator](/docs/glacial-precipitator/) to produce [packed
ice](https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Packed_Ice) instead of
[ice](https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Ice).


Obtaining
---------

### Crafting
{% include recipe-table.html type='crafting' recipes=page.recipes.crafting no-result=true %}

Note that [cryotheum dust](/docs/cryotheum-dust/) and [gelid
cryotheum](/docs/gelid-cryotheum/) can be used to make packed ice.


Usage
-----

### Installation
A permafrost compressor can be installed in the Augmentation tab in a [glacial
precipitator](/docs/glacial-precipitator/)'s GUI. It is a specialization that
cannot be installed together with other specialization augments.

### Effects
An installed permafrost compressor replaces a [glacial
precipitator](/docs/glacial-precipitator/)'s ability to produce
[ice](https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Ice) with the ability to produce [packed
ice](https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Packed_Ice).
