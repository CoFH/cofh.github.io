An **ender substrate** is an [augment](/docs/augments/) that allows for a
[phytogenic insolator](/docs/phytogenic-insolator/) to grow crops from the
[End](https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/The_End), such as [chorus
plants](https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Chorus_Plant).


Obtaining
---------

### Crafting
{% include recipe-table.html type='crafting' recipes=page.recipes.crafting no-result=true %}


Usage
-----

### Installation
An ender substrate can be installed in the Augmentation tab in a [phytogenic
insolator](/docs/phytogenic-insolator/)'s GUI. It is a specialization that
cannot be installed together with other specialization augments.

### Effects
An installed ender substrate adds some extra [recipes](#recipes) to a
[phytogenic insolator](/docs/phytogenic-insolator/). These recipes allow for
crops from the [End](https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/The_End) to be grown.

If another mod adds trees in the End, those can also be grown by installing both
an ender substrate and a [sapling infuser](/docs/augment-sapling-infuser/).
