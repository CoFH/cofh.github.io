**Silver ore** is a somewhat uncommon [ore](https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Ore)
that yields [silver](/docs/silver-ingot/) and small amounts of
[lead](/docs/lead-ingot/).


Obtaining
---------

Silver ore is less common than [iron
ore](https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Iron_Ore), but more common than [gold
ore](https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Gold_Ore). It occurs at low levels in the
world (layers 5-30). Silver ore veins are slightly smaller than iron ore veins,
and may contain one or two blocks of [lead ore](/docs/lead-ore/) as well.
Similarly, lead ore veins may contain one or two blocks of silver ore.

Silver ore must be mined with an [iron
pickaxe](https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Pickaxe) or better. If it is mined, it
drops itself as an item.
