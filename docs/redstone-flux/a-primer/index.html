    Redstone - the mysterious substance found deep underground - is the source of limitless potential in this new age of industrialization. In its native <a href="/docs/thermal-foundation/world-generation/ores/#vanilla-ores">Ore</a> form, it exhibits the fascinating property of absorbing kinetic impacts and emitting light. If a sufficiently strong implement, such as an Iron Pickaxe, is used to deliver these impacts, the Ore will shatter apart and release its precious contents in the most native form - Redstone Dust. Veritable treatises have been written on this particular form of Redstone and how it may be used to construct rudimentary circuitry, so this particular property will not be further elaborated upon in this writing.

    On a basic level, Redstone Flux is the name for the stored energy which manifests as a standing resonant wave in a mass of Redstone. The resonant properties of this wave means that this energy can be stored indefinitely, if contained properly. This is a logical extension of Redstone Dust's ability to maintain a signal indefinitely at a given point. The amount of energy that can be stored or transmitted through a given mass of Redstone is determined by various factors, such as the cross-sectional area and the saturation coefficient of the mass.

<p>
    To understand Redstone Flux and how it can be exploited for jolly industrialization, one must first understand two additional properties of Redstone - its response to heat and particular interactions with various metals.
</p>

<p>
    Redstone Dust at standard temperatures and pressures exists in a stable crystalline state. Leading researchers theorize that the ore's formation deep underground contributes to this stable structure, possibly through interaction with alluvial deposits of <a href="/docs/thermal-foundation/materials/cinnabar/">Cinnabar</a> - a native form of Mercury. Further research is required on this Mercury-Redstone interaction, with one researcher commenting that Redstone's complex structure makes this problem <q>somewhat like rocket science.</q>
</p>

<p>
    Exposure to low to moderate levels of heat has no apparent effect on Redstone, without a proper catalyst in place. However, extreme levels of heat in proper conditions where no air is present disrupts the crystalline structure of the Redstone Dust. Upon losing structure, Redstone becomes a fluid known as <a href="/docs/thermal-foundation/fluids/destabilized-redstone/">Destabilized Redstone</a> and will remain fluid at room temperature. As the extreme pressures required for initial crystal formation are not present, this fluid form of Redstone will persist even in sub-zero temperatures. Given the right temperature and pressure conditions, Destabilized Redstone could potentially be precipitated back into a crystalline form.
</p>

<p>
    Further compounding the enigmatic nature of Redstone are the interactions that both solid and fluid forms of Redstone have with various metals. It is through the understanding and exploitation of these interactions that Redstone Flux may be created, stored, and utilized to empower our creations and allow us to break from the shackles of manual labor. At the time of this writing, five metals exist which seem to have synergistic or catalytic properties with Redstone. They are as follows:
</p>

<p>
    <strong><a href="/docs/thermal-foundation/base-metals/copper/">Copper</a>:</strong> This reasonably common metal, when mixed in the proper quantities with <a href="/docs/thermal-foundation/base-metals/silver/">Silver</a> and combined with Destabilized Redstone, can form <a href="/docs/thermal-foundation/alloys/signalum/">Signalum</a> - an alloy capable of transmitting signals a long distance as well as having rudimentary sensitivity to magnetism. This alloy can be used as a "bridge" between Redstone Flux and electricity, as the conductive nature of the Silver and Copper allows for the flow of electrons.
</p>

<p>
    <strong><a href="/docs/thermal-foundation/base-metals/silver/">Silver</a>:</strong> This precious metal, when combined with Redstone Dust, is able to convert heat or electricity into Redstone Flux. Engineering advances have shown that a <a href="/docs/thermal-foundation/parts/redstone-transmission-coil/">coil-type geometry</a> can be used to optimize the production and transmission of this Redstone Flux. Essentially, Silver is most used in the generation of Redstone Flux. The engineering mnemonic for this is derived from Silver's chemical abbreviation - Ag - or "A Generator."
</p>

<p>
    <strong><a href="/docs/thermal-foundation/vanilla-materials/gold/">Gold</a>:</strong> This precious metal, when combined with Redstone Dust, is able to convert Redstone Flux into heat or magnetism. Engineering advances have shown that a <a href="/docs/thermal-foundation/parts/redstone-reception-coil/">coil-type geometry</a> can be used to optimize the reception and storage of Redstone Flux. Essentially, Gold is most used in the reception of Redstone Flux. The engineering mnemonic for this is derived from Gold's chemical abbreviation - Au - or "A User."
</p>

<p>
    <strong><a href="/docs/thermal-foundation/base-metals/lead/">Lead</a>:</strong> This metal can be used in the construction of rudimentary Redstone Flux devices. The density of the Lead acts to assist in containment of Redstone Flux, when otherwise the resonant waveform could escape or diminish with time.
</p>

<p>
    <strong><a href="/docs/thermal-foundation/alloys/electrum/">Electrum</a>:</strong> This metal is simply an alloy of Silver and Gold, and can be utilized for the purposes of either.
</p>

<p>
    Notes: Common to all of these metals is an extremely high resistance to corrosion. Redstone Flux is volatile in nature, and high levels of it can have unforeseen consequences if exposed to open air or organic substances. It should be emphasized that this list is by no means complete, and further research into this wondrous phenomenon may yet reveal new interactions. Especially promising are the theoretical interactions when Redstone Flux is combined with the fundamental fabric of spacetime - Ender. Those theories however, are beyond the scope of this document.
