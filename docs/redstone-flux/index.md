**Redstone Flux**, often referred to as **RF**, is the energy system used by the
mods of Team CoFH. Most of these mods have something that produces, moves,
stores or consumes Redstone Flux in one way or another. Many other mods also add
devices that work with Redstone Flux.

See [Redstone Flux: A Primer](/docs/redstone-flux/redstone-flux-a-primer/) for
an in-universe explanation of Redstone Flux.
