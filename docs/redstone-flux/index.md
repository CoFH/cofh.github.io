**Redstone Flux**, often referred to as **RF**, is the energy system used by the
mods of Team CoFH. As described in [Redstone Flux: A
Primer](/docs/redstone-flux/redstone-flux-a-primer/), it is an extension of the
redstone power system.

Various blocks and items in the CoFH mods consume Redstone Flux energy to
accomplish all kinds of tasks. Redstone Flux is usually consumed for one of two
reasons:

* replacing the requirement of manual labor in automated systems;
* adding a cost for doing things that otherwise wouldn't be possible.

The CoFH mods offer various ways to produce, move, store and consume Redstone
Flux, such as [Thermal Expansion](/docs/thermal-expansion/)'s dynamos and energy
cell, and [Thermal Dynamics](/docs/thermal-dynamics/)'s fluxducts. Many other
mods also add devices that work with Redstone Flux.
