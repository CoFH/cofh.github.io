<p>
    <strong>Redstone Flux</strong>, often referred to as <strong>RF</strong>, is the energy system used by the mods of Team CoFH. As described in <a href="/docs/redstone-flux/a-primer/">Redstone Flux: A Primer</a>, it is a natural extension of Minecraft's Redstone power system.
</p>

<p>
    Various blocks and items in the CoFH mods consume Redstone Flux energy to accomplish all kinds of tasks. Redstone Flux is usually consumed for one of two reasons:
</p>

<ul>
    <li>replacing the requirement of manual labor in automated systems;</li>
    <li>adding a cost to do things that otherwise wouldn't be possible.</li>
</ul>

<p>
    The CoFH mods offer various ways to generate, move and store Redstone Flux, such as <a href="/docs/thermal-expansion/">Thermal Expansion</a>'s Dynamos and <a href="/docs/thermal-expansion/storage/energy-cell/">Energy Cell</a>, and <a href="/docs/thermal-dynamics/">Thermal Dynamics</a>'s <a href="/docs/thermal-dynamics/ducts/fluxducts/">Fluxducts</a>. However, many other mods add more ways to handle Redstone Flux, in addition to more devices that consume it.

<p>
    Redstone Flux has a simple, easy-to-implement API that mods may use to add compatibility for it. This API is part of the <a href="https://github.com/CoFH/CoFHLib/tree/master/src/main/java/cofh/api" target="_blank">CoFH API</a> in <a href="/docs/cofhlib">CoFHLib</a>, but a standalone version can also be found <a href="https://github.com/CoFH/RedstoneFlux-API" target="_blank">here</a>.
</p>

<p>
    Many mods are compatible with the Redstone Flux system, and thus with the CoFH mods and each other. However, if you are the developer of a mod that involves energy in some way, please don't feel pressured to make it compatible with Redstone Flux. See <a href="{% link _posts/2014-09-03-so-rf-is-a-thing.md %}">this post</a> for more on that.
