**Covers** are items that can be installed on ducts to hide them, making them
look like solid blocks.


Obtaining

### Crafting
{% include recipe-table.html type='crafting' recipes=page.recipes.crafting no-result=true %}


Usage
-----

A cover can be installed on any side of a duct by using it on the duct. It can
be removed by using a [crescent hammer](/docs/crescent-hammer/) or similar on
it.

Installed covers do not affect how ducts work in any way. When a duct goes
through a cover, a hole is made in the cover.
