A **nether substrate** is an [augment](/docs/augments/) that allows for a
[phytogenic insolator](/docs/phytogenic-insolator/) to grow crops from the
[Nether](https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/The_Nether), such as [nether
wart](https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Nether_Wart).


Obtaining
---------

### Crafting
{% include recipe-table.html type='crafting' recipes=page.recipes.crafting no-result=true %}


Usage
-----

### Installation
A nether substrate can be installed in the Augmentation tab in a [phytogenic
insolator](/docs/phytogenic-insolator/)'s GUI. It is a specialization that
cannot be installed together with other specialization augments.

### Effects
An installed nether substrate adds some extra [recipes](#recipes) to a
[phytogenic insolator](/docs/phytogenic-insolator/). These recipes allow for
crops from the [Nether](https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/The_Nether) to be grown.

If another mod adds trees in the Nether, those can also be grown by installing
both a nether substrate and a [sapling infuser](/docs/augment-sapling-infuser/).
