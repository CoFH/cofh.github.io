A **fluxbore** (also known as a **drill**) is a tool that mines blocks using
[Redstone Flux](/docs/redstone-flux/). It functions as both a
[pickaxe](https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Pickaxe) and a
[shovel](https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Shovel).


Obtaining
---------

### Crafting
{% include recipe-table.html type='crafting' recipes=page.recipes.crafting %}


Usage
-----

### Charging
A fluxbore can be charged with [Redstone Flux](/docs/redstone-flux/) using an
[energetic infuser](/docs/energetic-infuser/) or similar.

A basic fluxbore can hold up to 40,000 RF and can be charged at up to 1,000
RF/t. This can be increased by upgrading the fluxbore to a higher
[tier](#tiers).

An uncharged fluxbore is still usable and will not break when used, but it is
very weak.

### Mining
A fluxbore can be used as both a
[pickaxe](https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Pickaxe) and a
[shovel](https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Shovel). It consumes 200 RF for each
mined block.

A basic fluxbore is comparable to an [iron
pickaxe](https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Iron_Pickaxe) or
[shovel](https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Iron_Shovel). It becomes more powerful
when upgraded to a higher [tier](#tiers).

At higher tiers, a fluxbore can be configured to mine multiple blocks at once in
a certain area. The current mining area of a fluxbore can be set by pressing
"Cycle Item Mode" (V by default) while holding it. When mining multiple blocks,
a fluxbore works slightly slower.

### Weapon
A fluxbore has an attack speed of 1.8. When uncharged, it deals 2 damage. When
charged, a basic fluxbore deals 3 damage. The damage when charged can be
increased by upgrading the fluxbore to a higher [tier](#tiers). A fluxbore
consumes 400 RF per hit.

### Enchantments
A fluxbore can receive all the enchantments that
[pickaxes](https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Pickaxe) and
[shovels](https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Shovel) can receive.

A basic fluxbore has an
[enchantability](https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Enchantability) of 10. This can
be increased by upgrading the fluxbore to a higher [tier](#tiers).

When enchanted with [Unbreaking](https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Unbreaking), a
fluxbore has a chance to not consume [Redstone Flux](/docs/redstone-flux/) when
used.

| Unbreaking level | No energy use chance |
|---
| I | 33% |
| II | 50% |
| III | 60% |

A fluxbore can also be enchanted with [Holding](/docs/holding/) to increase its
energy capacity.

| Holding level | Capacity multiplier |
|---
| I | × 1.5 |
| II | × 2 |
| III | × 2.5 |
| IV | × 3 |

Tiers
-----

Fluxbores come in six [tiers](/docs/tiers/).
