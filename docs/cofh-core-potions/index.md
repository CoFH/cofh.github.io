[CoFH Core](/docs/cofh-core/) adds several new
[potions](https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Potion) to the game, along with
stronger versions of some existing potions.


New potions
-----------

Several new potions are added, all of which apply
[effects](https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Status_effects) that do not have
corresponding potions in the base game. [Thermal
Foundation](/docs/thermal-foundation/) adds [recipes](/docs/potion-recipes/) to
obtain these potions.

Stronger potions
----------------

The following potions gain additional stronger levels, most going up to level V.
These cannot be made with a [brewing
stand](https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Brewing_Stand). When [Thermal
Expansion](/docs/thermal-expansion/) is installed, they can be obtained by
refining potions as [fluids](/docs/potion-fluid/) in a [fractionating
still](/docs/fractionating-still/) with an [alchemical
retort](/docs/augment-alchemical-retort/) installed.
