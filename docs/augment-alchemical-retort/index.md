An **alchemical retort** is an [augment](/docs/augments/) that allows for a
[fractionating still](/docs/fractionating-still/) to refine level II [fluid
potions](/docs/potion-fluid/), further increasing their potency level.


Obtaining
---------

### Crafting
{% include recipe-table.html type='crafting' recipes=page.recipes.crafting no-result=true %}


Usage
-----

### Installation
An alchemical retort can be installed in the Augmentation tab in a
[fractionating still](/docs/fractionating-still/)'s GUI. It is a specialization
that cannot be installed together with other specialization augments.

### Effects
A [fractionating still](/docs/fractionating-still/) with an alchemical retort
installed can refine level II [fluid potions](/docs/potion-fluid/) to increase
their potency level to [levels up to
V](/docs/cofh-core-potions/#stronger-potions). However, the machine cannot
process anything other than potions.

Refining a fluid potion requires 2,500 RF per operation. The amount of fluid
consumed and produced per operation differs depending on the potency level of
the potion that is being refined.
