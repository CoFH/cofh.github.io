An **agitative manifold** is an [augment](/docs/thermal-expansion/augments/)
that increases the amount of [Redstone Flux](/docs/redstone-flux/) a
[compression dynamo](/docs/thermal-expansion/compression-dynamo/) generates
using [grassoline](/docs/thermal-foundation/grassoline/).


Obtaining
---------

### Crafting
{% include recipe-table.html type='crafting' recipes=page.recipes.crafting no-result=true %}


Usage
-----

### Installation
An agitative manifold can be installed in the Augmentation tab in a [compression
dynamo](/docs/thermal-expansion/compression-dynamo/)'s GUI. It is a
specialization that cannot be installed together with other specialization
augments.

### Effects
An installed agitative manifold triples the maximum power output of a
[compression dynamo](/docs/thermal-expansion/compression-dynamo/), and increases
the amount of [Redstone Flux](/docs/redstone-flux/) it generates from each unit
of fuel by 25%. However, the dynamo can only generate energy using
[grassoline](/docs/thermal-foundation/grassoline/).

If an agitative manifold is installed together with other augments that affect
the amount of energy generated from each unit of fuel, their energy
increase/decrease percentages are added together before being applied to the
amount of energy.
