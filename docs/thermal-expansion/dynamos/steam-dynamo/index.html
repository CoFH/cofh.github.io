<p>The <strong>Steam Dynamo</strong> is one of the Dynamos added by Thermal Expansion. It generates <a href="/docs/redstone-flux">Redstone Flux</a> from <a href="/docs/thermal-foundation/fluids/steam">Steam</a>. Steam can be pumped in from external sources, but it can also be generated internally using Water and solid fuels.</p>

<h2 id="operation">Operation</h2>
<p>The Steam Dynamo generates energy from <a href="/docs/thermal-foundation/fluids/steam">Steam</a> at a ratio of 2 RF per mB. It only generates if 2000 or more mB of Steam is stored in the Dynamo's internal tank. When not generating, any Steam stored in the Dynamo is gradually lost.</p>

<p>Steam may be pumped into the Dynamo from external sources. The Steam Dynamo can also internally convert Water into Steam using solid fuels. In this case, Water must be pumped in or put in manually using Buckets. <a href="/docs/thermal-expansion/machines/aqueous-accumulator">Aqueous Accumulators</a> can be used to easily produce Water for this.</p>

<h2 id="power">Power</h2>
<p>The Steam Dynamo generates energy at a maximum rate of 80 RF per tick. This rate may decrease depending on how full the Dynamo's internal storage is, which may fill up if the Dynamo cannot emit its energy. The rate may be reduced down to a minimum of 8 RF per tick. At this point, generated energy that cannot be stored anywhere is lost.</p>

<p>Installing the <a href="/docs/thermal-expansion/augments/dynamo-advanced-throttling">Excitation Field Limiter</a> <a href="/docs/thermal-expansion/augments/augmentation">Augment</a> removes this lower limit, allowing the Dynamo to automatically stop generating energy completely if needed.</p>

<h2 id="input-output">Input/Output</h2>
<p>Energy generated by the Steam Dynamo is stored in the Dynamo's internal energy storage. It is then emitted as soon as possible in the direction in which the Dynamo's red coil is pointing. The Dynamo does not emit energy if it is inactive, even if some generated energy is still stored in it.</p>

<p>The Dynamo accepts Steam, Water and fuel items from external sources like Machines or <a href="/docs/thermal-dynamics">Ducts</a>. These can be inserted on all sides of the Dynamo, except for the coil. However, if the <a href="/docs/thermal-expansion/augments/dynamo-side-accessibility">Transmission Coil Ducting</a> <a href="/docs/thermal-expansion/augments/augmentation">Augment</a> is installed, that side may also receive them.</p>

<h2 id="fuels">Fuels</h2>
<p>The below table lists the items that can be used as fuel for producing <a href="/docs/thermal-foundation/fluids/steam">Steam</a> internally. It displays how much energy the Dynamo can generate from each kind of fuel. Items that yield less energy are used up more quickly.</p>

<p>Keep in mind that the Dynamo does not generate energy if less than 2000 mB of Steam is stored in its internal tank. Burning a piece of fuel will therefore not always yield the full amount of energy, as Steam is produced from burning fuel and then consumed to generate energy.</p>
