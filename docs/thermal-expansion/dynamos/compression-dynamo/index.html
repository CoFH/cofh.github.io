<p>The <strong>Compression Dynamo</strong> is one of the Dynamos added by Thermal Expansion. It generates <a href="/docs/redstone-flux/">Redstone Flux</a> using fluid fuel and coolant.</p>

<h2 id="operation">Operation</h2>
<p>The Compression Dynamo generates energy using fluid fuel and coolant. It does not work if there is fuel but not coolant in its internal tanks, and vice versa; the Dynamo essentially consumes two kinds of 'fuel' simultaneously.</p>

<h2 id="power">Power</h2>
<p>The Compression Dynamo generates energy at a maximum rate of 80 RF per tick. This rate may decrease depending on how full the Dynamo's internal storage is, which can fill up if the Dynamo cannot emit its energy. The rate may be reduced down to a minimum of 8 RF per tick. At this point, generated energy that cannot be stored anywhere is lost.</p>

<p>Installing the <a href="/docs/thermal-expansion/augments/dynamo-advanced-throttling/">Excitation Field Limiter</a> <a href="/docs/thermal-expansion/augments/augmentation/">Augment</a> removes this lower limit, allowing the Dynamo to automatically stop generating energy completely if needed.</p>

<h2 id="input-output">Input/Output</h2>
<p>Energy generated by the Compression Dynamo is stored in the Dynamo's internal energy storage. It is then emitted as soon as possible in the direction in which the Dynamo's red coil is pointing. The Dynamo does not emit energy if it is inactive, even if some generated energy is still stored in it.</p>

<p>The Dynamo accepts fluids that count as fuel or coolant from external sources like Machines or <a href="/docs/thermal-dynamics/">Ducts</a>. These can be inserted on all sides of the Dynamo, except for the coil. However, if the <a href="/docs/thermal-expansion/augments/dynamo-side-accessibility/">Transmission Coil Ducting</a> <a href="/docs/thermal-expansion/augments/augmentation/">Augment</a> is installed, that side may also receive them.</p>

<h2 id="fuels">Fuels</h2>
<p>The below table lists the fluids that can be used as fuel for the Compression Dynamo. It displays how much energy the Dynamo can generate from a <em>Bucket</em> (1000 mB) of each kind of fuel. Fluids that yield less energy are consumed more quickly.</p>

<h2 id="coolants">Coolants</h2>
<p>The below table lists the fluids that can be used as coolant for the Compression Dynamo. It displays how long a <em>Bucket</em> (1000 mB) of each coolant lasts, expressed in the amounts of energy the Dynamo can generate with them. These energy amounts are <em>not</em> added to the amounts of energy generated using the above fuels.</p>
