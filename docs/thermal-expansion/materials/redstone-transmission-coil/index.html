<p><strong>Redstone Transmission Coils</strong> are crafting materials added by Thermal Expansion. This combination of <a href="/docs/thermal-foundation/base-metals/silver">Silver</a> and Redstone is commonly used when converting various kinds of energy into <a href="/docs/redstone-flux">Redstone Flux</a>.</p>

<p>As a result, Dynamos (which generate Redstone Flux) require Redstone Transmission Coils to craft. A mnemonic for this is derived from Silver's chemical abbreviation: <q>Ag</q> could be seen as <q>A Generator</q>.</p>
