<p><strong>Redstone Conductance Coils</strong> are crafting materials added by Thermal Expansion. This combination of <a href="/docs/thermal-foundation/alloys/electrum/">Electrum</a> and Redstone is commonly used when storing large amounts of <a href="/docs/redstone-flux/">Redstone Flux</a>. Because Electrum consists of both <a href="/docs/thermal-foundation/vanilla-materials/gold/">Gold</a> and <a href="/docs/thermal-foundation/base-metals/silver/">Silver</a>, the resulting Coils can be used to both receive and provide Redstone Flux.</p>

<p>Devices that can store a significant amount of Redstone Flux or devices that can charge items usually require Redstone Conductance Coils to craft. A mnemonic for this is derived from the fact that these Coils are essentially combinations of <a href="/docs/thermal-expansion/materials/redstone-reception-coil/">Redstone Reception Coils</a> and <a href="/docs/thermal-expansion/materials/redstone-transmission-coil/">Redstone Transmission Coils</a>: they are both <q>A User</q> and <q>A Generator</q>.</p>
