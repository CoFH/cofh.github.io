<p><strong>Redstone Reception Coils</strong> are crafting materials added by Thermal Expansion. This combination of <a href="/docs/thermal-foundation/vanilla-materials/gold/">Gold</a> and Redstone is commonly used when converting <a href="/docs/redstone-flux/">Redstone Flux</a> into other kinds of energy, like heat or magnetism.</p>

<p>As a result, Machines or devices that use Redstone Flux usually require Redstone Reception Coils to craft. A mnemonic for this is derived from Gold's chemical abbreviation: <q>Au</q> could be seen as <q>A User</q>.</p>
