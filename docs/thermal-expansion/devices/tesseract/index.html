<blockquote>The End is actually just the beginning.</blockquote>

<p>The <strong>Tesseract</strong> is one of the Devices added by Thermal Expansion. It harnesses the power of <a href="/docs/thermal-foundation/fluids/resonant-ender/">Resonant Ender</a> to create a unified point in spacetime. This allows for the instant transport of items, fluids and <a href="/docs/redstone-flux/">Redstone Flux</a> across vast distances, and even between dimensions.</p>

<p>Contrary to popular belief, when transferring Redstone Flux through a Tesseract, none of it is lost.</p>

<h2 id="operation">Operation</h2>
<p>A Tesseract is initially inactive. In order to be made active, a frequency must be specified in the Tesseract's <a href="#gui">GUI</a>. Active Tesseracts can be distinguished from inactive ones by their looks:</p>

<p>When items, fluids or energy are transferred into an active Tesseract, and it is configured to send it, the Tesseract attempts to transfer it to any other Tesseracts on the same frequency that are configured to receive it. Items, fluids and energy are evenly divided over all available Tesseracts.</p>

<dl class="uk-description-list-line">
    <dt>1. Frequency Field</dt>
    <dd>Allows setting the Tesseract's frequency manually. Only numerical values can be entered. The Set Frequency Button must be clicked to actually set the frequency.</dd>

    <dt>2. Set Frequency Button</dt>
    <dd>Tunes the Tesseract to the frequency specified in the Frequency Field.</dd>

    <dt>3. Disable Button</dt>
    <dd>Removes the Tesseract from the currently tuned frequency, deactivating it.</dd>

    <dt>4. Frequency Name Field</dt>
    <dd>Allows assigning a name to the currently tuned frequency, so that it can be added to the list of named frequencies.</dd>

    <dt>5. Save Frequency Button</dt>
    <dd>Saves the currently tuned frequency's name, specified in the Frequency Name Field, to the list of named frequencies.</dd>

    <dt>6. Delete Frequency Button</dt>
    <dd>Removes the currently selected frequency from the list of named frequencies.</dd>

    <dt>7. Named Frequency List</dt>
    <dd>Lists all available named frequencies. Clicking on a frequency in the list selects it, so that the Tesseract may be tuned to it or so that the user may edit or remove it. The frequency that the Tesseract is currently tuned to is highlighted, if applicable.</dd>

    <dt>8. Information Tab</dt>
    <dd>Displays a bit of information about the Tesseract.</dd>

    <dt>9. Tutorial Tab</dt>
    <dd>Explains various things about the Tesseract and the other tabs in the GUI.</dd>

    <dt>10. Redstone Control Tab</dt>
    <dd>Allows setting how the Tesseract responds to Redstone signals. By default, Redstone signals deactivate Tesseracts, but without removing their frequencies.</dd>

    <dt>11. Configuration Tab</dt>
    <dd>Allows configuring what the Tesseract may or may not send and/or receive. Can be set separately for items, fluids and energy.</dd>

    <dt>12. Security Tab</dt>
    <dd>Allows setting who is allowed to access the Tesseract. Also allows using restricted or private frequency ranges, which are not publicly visible or usable. Only available if a <a href="/docs/thermal-expansion/materials/signalum-security-lock/">Signalum Security Lock</a> is installed.</dd>
