<blockquote>Some call it the Project Table III.</blockquote>

<p>The <strong>Machinist's Workbench</strong> is one of the Devices added by Thermal Expansion. It is a combination of a Crafting Table and a Chest. It can store crafting ingredients as well as multiple crafting recipes. Unlike the Crafting Table, the Workbench does not lose items when its GUI is closed, and players that access it share GUIs instead of working separately.</p>

<p><a href="/docs/thermal-expansion/storage/schematic/">Schematics</a> allow the Workbench to store multiple crafting recipes at once.</p>

<p>This Device can only be used for manual crafting. For automated crafting, see <a href="/docs/thermal-expansion/machines/cyclic-assembler/">Cyclic Assembler</a>.</p>

<h2 id="usage">Usage</h2>
<p>The Machinist's Workbench works similarly to the Crafting Table, with a few differences. First of all, crafting ingredients are not consumed directly from the crafting grid. Instead, recipes must first be drawn on the crafting grid by clicking on its slots with items. Crafting ingredients are then consumed from the Workbench's internal inventory upon crafting, keeping the drawn recipe intact.</p>

<p>Writing recipes to <a href="/docs/thermal-expansion/storage/schematic/">Schematics</a> and storing them in the Workbench allows for quick switching between up to three recipes. It also allows for crafting using stored recipes directly, without affecting the crafting grid.</p>

<h2 id="gui">GUI</h2>
<img src="/assets/images/thermal-expansion/machinists-workbench-gui.png" title="Machinist's Workbench GUI" />

<dl class="uk-description-list-line">
    <dt>1. Crafting Grid</dt>
    <dd>Crafting recipes can be drawn here by clicking on the grid's slots with items. If a valid recipe is drawn, but insufficient crafting ingredients are available, the slots in the grid that display missing ingredients are colored red.</dd>

    <dt>2. Crafting Ingredients</dt>
    <dd>Crafting ingredients to be used by the Workbench to craft things must be stored here.</dd>

    <dt>3. Output Slot</dt>
    <dd>Displays crafting results. Items are crafted by taking them from this slot if sufficient crafting ingredients are available.</dd>

    <dt>4. Crafting Grid Button</dt>
    <dd>If the crafting grid is not empty, clicking this button clears it. If the crafting grid is empty and a written Schematic is selected in the Schematic slots, clicking this button draws that Schematic's recipe onto the crafting grid.</dd>

    <dt>5. Schematic Write Button</dt>
    <dd>If a valid crafting recipe is drawn in the crafting grid and a Schematic is selected in the Schematic slots, clicking this button writes the drawn recipe to that Schematic.</dd>

    <dt>6. Schematic Slots</dt>
    <dd>Allows storing up to three Schematics in the Workbench. Clicking on a stored Schematic selects it for use with the two buttons next to the crafting grid. Holding Shift and right clicking a stored written Schematic crafts stored recipes directly, without affecting the crafting grid.</dd>

    <dt>7. Information Tab</dt>
    <dd>Displays a bit of information about the Workbench.</dd>

    <dt>8. Security Tab</dt>
    <dd>Allows setting who is allowed to access the Workbench. Only available if a <a href="/docs/thermal-expansion/materials/signalum-security-lock/">Signalum Security Lock</a> is installed.</dd>

    <dt>9. Player Inventory</dt>
    <dd>The inventory and hotbar of the player that is accessing the Workbench.</dd>
