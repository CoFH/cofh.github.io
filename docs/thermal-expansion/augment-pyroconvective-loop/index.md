A **pyroconvective loop** is an [augment](/docs/thermal-expansion/augments/) that greatly
increases the processing speed of a [magma crucible](/docs/thermal-expansion/magma-crucible/) that
produces [lava](https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Lava).


Obtaining
---------

### Crafting
{% include recipe-table.html type='crafting' recipes=page.recipes.crafting no-result=true %}


Usage
-----

### Installation
A pyroconvective loop can be installed in the Augmentation tab in a [magma
crucible](/docs/thermal-expansion/magma-crucible/)'s GUI. It is a specialization that cannot be
installed together with other specialization augments.

### Effects
An installed pyroconvective loop increases a [magma
crucible](/docs/thermal-expansion/magma-crucible/)'s maximum power usage by a factor of 10,
thereby greatly increasing its processing speed. However, the machine can only
produce [lava](https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Lava).
