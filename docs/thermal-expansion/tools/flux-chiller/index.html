<ul>
    <li>Any solid blocks that are flat on top get Snow layers placed on top of them.</li>
    <li>Water is turned into Ice.</li>
    <li>Lava is turned into <a href="/docs/thermal-foundation/vanilla-materials/obsidian/">Obsidian</a>.</li>
    <li>Entities that are on fire are extinguished.</li>
</ul>

<p>The tool can be used up to 200 times without needing a recharge.</p>
