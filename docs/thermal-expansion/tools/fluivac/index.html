<p>The <strong>FluiVac</strong> is a <a href="/docs/redstone-flux">Redstone Flux</a>-powered tool added by Thermal Expansion. It is capable of pulling fluids from the world and storing them in items, and taking fluids from items and placing them in the world. It can also interact like this with blocks in the world that can store fluids. The FluiVac can store up to 80,000 RF and consumes 200 RF per use.</p>

<h2 id="usage">Usage</h2>
<p>By default, the FluiVac is in input mode. In this mode, parts of the tool are colored blue.</p>

<p>When using the FluiVac on a fluid block in input mode, that block is pulled out of the world. When instead using the FluiVac on a side of a block that can store fluids, it tries to pull a bucket worth of fluid at most out of that block. This only works with block sides that can output fluids.</p>

<p>Fluids pulled by the FluiVac are moved into items in the user's inventory that can store it.</p>

<p>The FluiVac can be toggled between input and output mode by pressing the C key (changeable) while holding it. In output mode, parts of the FluiVac are colored orange instead of blue.</p>

<p>When using the tool in output mode, it uses a bucket worth of fluid at most from items in the user's inventory that can store fluids. This fluid is then either placed into the world as a fluid block, or inserted into a side of a block that can store fluids. The former only works if the fluid has a corresponding fluid block, and the latter only works when aiming at block sides that can receive (sometimes specific types of) fluids.</p>

<p>The tool can be used up to 400 times without needing a recharge. The amount of fluid moved by it at once may be limited by the blocks or items between which fluids are moved.</p>
