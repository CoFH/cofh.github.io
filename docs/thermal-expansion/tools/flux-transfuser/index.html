<p>The <strong>Flux Transfuser</strong> is a tool added by Thermal Expansion. It can be used by players to extract <a href="/docs/redstone-flux">Redstone Flux</a> from blocks in the world and store it in chargeable items in their inventory. It can also be used to do the opposite: charging blocks in the world using energy from items that store Redstone Flux.</p>

<h2 id="usage">Usage</h2>
<p>By default, the Flux Transfuser is in input mode. In this mode, some parts of the Transfuser are colored blue. When using the Transfuser on a side of a block in this mode, it tries to extract 100,000 RF at most from that block, and then insert that energy into items in the user's inventory that can receive it. This only works with block sides that can provide Redstone Flux, like orange-colored sides on <a href="/docs/thermal-expansion/storage/energy-cells">Energy Cells</a>.</p>

<p>The Flux Transfuser can be toggled between input and output mode by pressing the C key (changeable) while holding it. In output mode, some parts of the Transfuser are colored orange instead of blue. When using the Transfuser on a side of a block in this mode, it tries to insert 100,000 RF at most into that block, using energy from items in the user's inventory that can provide it. This only works with block sides that can receive Redstone Flux, like blue-colored sides on Energy Cells.</p>

<p>The amount of energy moved at once by the Transfuser may be limited by the blocks or items between which energy is moved.</p>
