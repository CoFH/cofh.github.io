**Strongboxes** are a type of block added by [Thermal Expansion](/docs/thermal-expansion/). They store items, exactly like Chests do, but with several benefits.

Strongboxes are harder to break and more resistant to explosions. They can also have [Signalum Security Locks](/docs/thermal-expansion/materials/signalum-security-lock/) installed on them. Lastly, Strongboxes can be moved around without losing any stored items by dismantling them with a [Crescent Hammer](/docs/thermal-expansion/tools/crescent-hammer/). They can only be opened when placed in the world, though.

To prevent creating infinite storage, as well as some world-corrupting issues, Strongboxes cannot store items that can also store items themselves, like other Strongboxes and [Satchels](/docs/thermal-expansion/storage/satchel/).

## Tiers

Strongboxes follow Thermal Expansion's [tier system](/docs/thermal-expansion/tiers-and-augments/tiers/). Strongboxes can be upgraded using [Upgrade Kits](/docs/thermal-expansion/tiers-and-augments/upgrade-kits/).

The tier of a Strongbox determines several of its properties: storage capacity, block hardness and resistance to explosions.

The Creative Strongbox can have an infinite amount of a certain item taken out of it. For obvious reasons, this Strongbox tier cannot be legitimately obtained.

The following table shows the block hardness and explosion resistance of Strongboxes per tier. For comparison, see [Blocks by hardness](http://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Breaking#Blocks_by_hardness) and [Blast resistance](http://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Explosion#Blast_resistance) on the Minecraft Wiki.

## Capacity

Strongboxes can be enchanted with the [Holding](/docs/cofh-core/enchantments/holding/) enchantment to increase their capacity. This means that the capacity of a Strongbox depends on two things: [tier](/docs/thermal-expansion/other/tier-system/) and Holding enchantment level.

The following table shows how many storage slots Strongboxes have, depending on tier and Holding enchantment level.

The Creative Strongbox always has only one slot, regardless of enchantments.
