<p><strong>Dynamo: Advanced Throttling</strong> (seen ingame as the Excitation Field Limiter) is a type of <a href="/docs/thermal-expansion/augments/augmentation/">Augment</a> that allows Dynamos to reduce their output rate to 0 RF/t when they cannot transfer their generated <a href="/docs/redstone-flux/">Redstone Flux</a> anywhere and their energy buffer fills up.</p>

<p>Dynamos also reduce their output rate by default when this happens, but not all the way to zero, causing energy to be lost and fuel to be wasted.</p>

<p>This is a Level II Augment that requires the <a href="/docs/thermal-expansion/augments/redstone-control/">Integrated Redstone Circuit</a> to be installed as well to work, and thus occupies two Augment slots. Unlike other Augments, this doesn't disable the lower Level Augment's effects (Redstone Control).</p>

<p>This Augment type is useful for creating compact setups with Dynamos; especially when <a href="/docs/thermal-dynamics/item-transport/fluctuating-itemduct/">Fluctuating Itemducts</a> and/or <a href="/docs/thermal-dynamics/fluid-transport/flux-plated-fluiduct/">Flux-Plated Fluiducts</a> are added to the mix.</p>
