<p><strong>Automated Output</strong> (seen ingame as the Integrated Servo Mechanism) is a type of <a href="/docs/thermal-expansion/augments/augmentation">Augment</a> that allows Machines to automatically transfer output items or fluids into adjacent blocks that can accept them. This includes <a href="/docs/thermal-dynamics">Ducts</a>, other Machines or other types of inventories and/or tanks. Items and fluids are evenly divided between available outputs.</p>

<p>Items are transferred out every time a Machine completes an operation, as well as every 1.6 seconds (32 ticks). The amount of items transferred at once is limited by <a href="/docs/thermal-expansion/materials/machine-frames">Machine Frame</a> <a href="/docs/thermal-expansion/other/tier-system">tier</a>: Basic Machines can transfer 8 items at a time, Hardened Machines 16 items, Reinforced Machines 32 items and Resonant Machines 64 items.</p>

<p>Fluids are transferred out at a maximum rate of 500 mB/t. This rate may be limited by blocks receiving the fluids.</p>

<p>Newly crafted Machines come with this Augment already installed, unless disabled in the config.</p>
