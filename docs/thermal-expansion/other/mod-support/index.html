title: Mod Support
---

<p>Other than the support with other mods gained through Minecraft Forge, Thermal Expansion integrates with a bunch of mods in particular. This page lists those mods, and how Thermal Expansion integrates with them.</p>

<h2 id="not-enough-items"><a href="http://www.curse.com/mc-mods/minecraft/222211-notenoughitems" target="_blank">Not Enough Items</a></h2>
<p>The recipes of most Machines that process items or fluids can be looked up through NEI. Furthermore, the <a href="/docs/thermal-expansion/devices/machinists-workbench">Machinist's Workbench</a> has support for NEI's <q>?</q> button, which automatically draws recipes onto the crafting grid.</p>

<h2 id="minefactory-reloaded"><a href="/docs/minefactory-reloaded">MineFactory Reloaded</a></h2>
<p><a href="/docs/thermal-expansion/materials/phyto-gro">Phyto-Gro</a> and <a href="/docs/thermal-expansion/materials/phyto-gro">Rich Phyto-Gro</a> can be used by the <a href="/docs/minefactory-reloaded/farming-machines/fertilizer">Fertilizer</a> to grow plants quickly. Rich Phyto-Gro lasts much longer than Phyto-Gro in this machine.</p>

<h2 id="equivalent-exchange-3"><a href="http://ee3.pahimar.com/">Equivalent Exchange 3</a></h2>
<p>The recipe lists of most Machines are registered with EE3, so that it can calculate more accurate EMC values with them.</p>

<h2 id="thaumcraft"><a href="http://www.curse.com/mc-mods/minecraft/223628-thaumcraft" target="_blank">Thaumcraft</a></h2>
<p>Machines and various tools and materials in the mod are given appropriate Aspects for research or extracting Essentia.</p>
