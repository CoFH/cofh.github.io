<p>Several of Thermal Expansion's blocks and items follow a set <strong>tier system</strong>. This tier system consists of five tiers: Basic/Leadstone, Hardened, Reinforced/Redstone, Signalum, and Resonant. This page describes each of those tiers.</p>

<p>The following blocks and items currently follow this tier system:</p>

<h4>Thermal Expansion</h4>
<ul>
    <li><a href="/docs/thermal-expansion/machines">Machines</a></li>
    <li><a href="/docs/thermal-expansion/storage/portable-tanks/">Portable Tanks</a></li>

</ul>

<h2>The Tiers</h2>

<h3 id="basic">Tier 1 - Basic/Leadstone</h3>
<p>Common Materials: <a href="/docs/thermal-foundation/base-metals/lead/">Lead</a>, Redstone (solid), Glass, <a href="/docs/thermal-foundation/base-metals/tin/">Tin</a></p>
<p>Items of this tier are the weakest and easiest to obtain. A good way to start off with the mod is to mine deep down in the world; <a href="/docs/thermal-foundation/world-generation/ores/#lead-ore">Lead</a>, <a href="/docs/thermal-foundation/world-generation/ores/#tin-ore">Tin</a> and Redstone Ore all generate at low levels.</p>

<h3 id="hardened">Tier 2 - Hardened</h3>
<p>Common Materials: <a href="/docs/thermal-foundation/alloys/invar/">Invar</a>, Redstone (solid), Glass</p>
<p>This tier is a slight improvement over the first tier; usually obtained by adding some Invar to items of that tier.</p>

<h3 id="reinforced">Tier 3 - Reinforced/Redstone</h3>
<p>Common Materials: <a href="/docs/thermal-foundation/alloys/electrum/">Electrum</a>, <a href="/docs/thermal-foundation/fluids/destabilized-redstone/">Destabilized Redstone</a>, <a href="/docs/thermal-expansion/materials/hardened-glass/">Hardened Glass</a>, Diamond</p>
<p>This tier replaces solid Redstone with the much more conductive Destabilized Redstone. As a result, this tier is a rather large jump from the earlier tiers.</p>

<h3 id="signalum">Tier 4 - Signalum</h3>
<p>Common Materials: <a href="/docs/thermal-foundation/alloys/signalum/">Signalum</a>, <a href="/docs/thermal-expansion/materials/hardened-glass/">Hardened Glass</a></p>
<p>Only present for certain items from Thermal Dynamics. Items of this tier are between the Reinforced/Redstone and Resonant tiers in terms of how powerful they are.</p>

<h3 id="resonant">Tier 5 - Resonant</h3>
<p>Common Materials: <a href="/docs/thermal-foundation/alloys/enderium/">Enderium</a>, <a href="/docs/thermal-foundation/fluids/destabilized-redstone/">Destabilized Redstone</a>, <a href="/docs/thermal-expansion/materials/hardened-glass/">Hardened Glass</a>, <a href="/docs/thermal-foundation/elemental-materials/pyrotheum-dust/">Pyrotheum Dust</a></p>
<p>Currently the most powerful tier. A significant improvement over the Reinforced/Redstone tier, usually obtained by adding some Enderium to items of that tier.</p>

<h3 id="creative">Creative Tier</h3>
<p>Common Materials: <em>None</em></p>
<p>Devices of this tier cannot be legitimately obtained. They are usually capable of things that would be unacceptable in normal play, but can be useful for testing. Usually this involves providing an infinite amount of something, or being able to do something an unlimited amount of times. Creative-tier devices are usually colored magenta, and have a big C on them.</p>

<h2>Upgrade Kits</h2>

<p>Upgrade kits are how you upgrade things. After placing it, right click it with an upgrade kit for the tier above the one it has.</p>

<p>You can also make conversion kits by combining upgrade kits these will fully upgrade a machine to the tier of the kit.</p>
