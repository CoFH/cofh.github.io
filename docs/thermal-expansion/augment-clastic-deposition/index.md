A **clastic deposition** [augment](/docs/thermal-expansion/augments/) allows for an [igneous
extruder](/docs/thermal-expansion/igneous-extruder/) to produce sedimentary rock, such as
[sand](https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Sand) or
[gravel](https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Gravel).


Obtaining
---------

### Crafting
{% include recipe-table.html type='crafting' recipes=page.recipes.crafting no-result=true %}


Usage
-----

### Installation
A clastic deposition augment can be installed in the Augmentation tab in an
[igneous extruder](/docs/thermal-expansion/igneous-extruder/)'s GUI. It is a specialization that
cannot be installed together with other specialization augments.

### Effects
An installed clastic deposition augment replaces an [igneous
extruder](/docs/thermal-expansion/igneous-extruder/)'s recipe set with [its own](#recipes). This
recipe set consists of producing various types of sedimentary rock.
