The **Sawmill** is one of the Machines added by Thermal Expansion. It uses [Redstone Flux](/docs/redstone-flux/) to cut wooden objects. It is capable of processing Wood logs more efficiently than by hand, as well as turning various things made of wood back into Wood Planks. The machine often produces [Sawdust](/docs/thermal-expansion/materials/sawdust/) as a byproduct.

Installing [Augments](/docs/thermal-expansion/tiers-and-augments/augments/) allows the Machine to work much faster or change its behavior.

### Crafting

## Power

When working at maximum speed, the Sawmill consumes 20 RF per tick. When its internal energy storage is starting to deplete, the Machine will slow down and use less power. This prevents sudden interruptions of the Sawmill's work when its power supply cuts short.

## GUI
