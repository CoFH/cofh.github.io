> SNOWBALL FIGHT!

The **Glacial Precipitator** is one of the Machines added by Thermal Expansion. It uses [Redstone Flux](/docs/redstone-flux/) to freeze fluids into solids. Currently the Machine only works with Water, which it can freeze into Snowballs, Snow blocks or Ice. However, in the future it may be extended to work with other fluids as well.

## Power

When working at maximum speed, the Glacial Precipitator consumes 20 RF per tick. When its internal energy storage is starting to deplete, the Machine will slow down and use less power. This prevents sudden interruptions of the Precipitator's work when its power supply cuts short.

## GUI
