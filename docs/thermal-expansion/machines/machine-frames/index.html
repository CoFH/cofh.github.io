<p><strong>Machine Frames</strong> are the central component of every Machine in Thermal Expansion. A Machine Frame of any type must be crafted in order to craft a Machine.</p>

<h2>Tiers</h2>
<p>There are four tiers of Machine Frames: one for every tier in the mod's <a href="/docs/thermal-expansion/other/tier-system">tier system</a>. When crafting a Machine with a certain tier of Machine Frame, the Machine will also be of that tier.</p>

<p>Machine Frames and Machines can be upgraded to higher tiers at one tier at a time. In order to craft Frames of higher tiers, the lower tier Frames must be crafted first.</p>

<p>
    The tier of a Machine determines several of its properties:
    
    <ul>
        <li>How many <a href="/docs/thermal-expansion/augments/augments">Augments</a> can be installed at once; starting at three, increasing by one per tier up to a maximum of six Augments</li>
        <li>Which (tiers of) <a href="/docs/thermal-expansion/augments/machine-augments">Machine Augments</a> can be installed</li>
        <li>The amount of <a href="/docs/redstone-flux">Redstone Flux</a> that can be stored in it</li>
        <li>The amount of Redstone Flux that it can receive at a time</li>
        <li>How much can be stored in its Fluid tank or tanks, if it has any</li>
        <li>How many items are ejected at a time, if the <a href="/docs/thermal-expansion/augments/augments/#automated-output">Integrated Servo Mechanism</a> Augment is installed</li>
    </ul>
</p>
