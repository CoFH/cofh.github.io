The **Magma Crucible** is one of the Machines added by Thermal Expansion. It uses [Redstone Flux](/docs/redstone-flux/) to melt down solid materials into fluids. This often takes a large amount of energy. The Machine is required to create most of the fluids in [Thermal Foundation](/docs/thermal-foundation/).

Installing [Augments](/docs/thermal-expansion/tiers-and-augments/augments/) allows the Machine to work much faster or change its behavior.

## Power

When working at maximum speed, the Magma Crucible consumes 400 RF per tick. When its internal energy storage is starting to deplete, the Machine will slow down and use less power. This prevents sudden interruptions of the Magma Crucible's work when its power supply cuts short.

The Magma Crucible is currently the Machine in Thermal Expansion that can consume the most power, consuming up to 8000 RF per tick with all three Processing Speed [Augments](/docs/thermal-expansion/augments/augmentation/) installed.
