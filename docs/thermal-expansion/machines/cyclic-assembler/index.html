<blockquote>No, it won't craft that.</blockquote>

<p>The <strong>Cyclic Assembler</strong> is one of the Machines added by Thermal Expansion. It uses <a href="/docs/redstone-flux">Redstone Flux</a> to craft items, using crafting recipes stored on <a href="/docs/thermal-expansion/storage/schematic">Schematics</a>.</p>

<h2 id="operation">Operation</h2>
<p>In order for the Cyclic Assembler to craft items, it must be given a written <a href="/docs/thermal-expansion/storage/schematic">Schematic</a> to tell it what crafting recipe to use. This is done by placing one in the Schematic slot in the Machine's <a href="#gui">GUI</a>.</p>

<p>Once given a Schematic, the Cyclic Assembler will try to perform the recipe whenever enough crafting ingredients are stored in its input slots, using 20 RF per craft. The Machine can perform a recipe once per tick, meaning that the Machine consumes 20 RF per tick when working constantly (as indicated by the Energy Tab in the GUI).</p>

<p>If a recipe produces leftover items upon crafting, like the three empty Buckets when crafting Cake, these items are placed back into the Machine's input slots.</p>

<p>Other than input slots for items, the Machine has an input tank for fluids. Fluids in this tank can be used by the Assembler to replace filled fluid container-type ingredients like Buckets when crafting. This way, leftover items like empty Buckets are not an issue.</p>

<p>For example, <a href="/docs/thermal-foundation/alloys/enderium/#crafting">Enderium Blends</a> can be produced by placing <a href="/docs/thermal-foundation/materials/pulverized-materials">Pulverized</a> <a href="/docs/thermal-foundation/base-metals/tin">Tin</a>, <a href="/docs/thermal-foundation/base-metals/silver">Silver</a> and <a href="/docs/thermal-foundation/base-metals/shiny-metal">Shiny Metal</a> in the Machine's input slots, and pumping buckets worth of <a href="/docs/thermal-foundation/fluids/resonant-ender">Resonant Ender</a> into the Assembler instead of putting Resonant Ender Buckets in its input slots.</p>

<h2 id="input-output">Input/Output</h2>
<p>The different sides of the Cyclic Assembler correspond to different color-coded slots and tanks in its GUI. These sides can be identified by color-coded openings in the sides of the Assembler. This is used for handling input and output with ducts/pipes/conduits/tubes, other Machines and other types of inventories and/or tanks.</p>

<p>If the <a href="/docs/thermal-expansion/augments/augments">Integrated Modular Framework</a> Augment is installed, this feature of the Assembler can be configured. Some things can be inserted from any side.</p>

<p>If the <a href="/docs/thermal-expansion/augments/augments">Integrated Servo Mechanism</a> Augment is installed, output items are automatically ejected from the corresponding sides of the Assembler, evenly divided between the available outputs.</p>

<p>If the <a href="/docs/thermal-expansion/augments/augments">Integrated Hopper Apparatus</a> Augment is installed, input items are automatically pulled into the Assembler from adjacent inventories at the corresponding sides.</p>
