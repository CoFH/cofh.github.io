> This thing rocks!

The **Igneous Extruder** is one of the Machines added by Thermal Expansion. It mixes Water and Lava into different types of igneous rock: [Cobblestone](https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Cobblestone), [Stone](https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Stone) and [Obsidian](https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Obsidian). This is one of the few Machines that doesn't use [Redstone Flux](/docs/redstone-flux/).

Installing [Augments](/docs/thermal-expansion/tiers-and-augments/augments/) allows the Machine to work much faster or change its behavior.

Some [Augments](/docs/thermal-expansion/tiers-and-augments/augments/) make it so the Machine can produce [Andesite](https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Andesite), [Diorite](https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Diorite) or [Granite](https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Granite) instead of stone.
