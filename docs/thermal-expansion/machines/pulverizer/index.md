> MACHINE SMASH! Puny ore.

The **Pulverizer** is one of the Machines added by Thermal Expansion. It uses [Redstone Flux](/docs/redstone-flux/) to smash things. The Machine is commonly used to process Ore blocks more efficiently than smelting them directly, but it also has many other helpful recipes.

Installing [Augments](/docs/thermal-expansion/tiers-and-augments/augments/) allows the Machine to work much faster or change its behavior.

## Power

When working at maximum speed, the Pulverizer consumes 40 RF per tick. When its internal energy storage is starting to deplete, the Machine will slow down and use less power. This prevents sudden interruptions of the Pulverizer's work when its power supply cuts short.
