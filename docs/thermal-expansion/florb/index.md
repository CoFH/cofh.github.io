A **florb** ('fluid orb') is a throwable item that contains a fluid.


Obtaining
---------

### Crafting
{% include recipe-table.html type='crafting' recipes=page.recipes.crafting no-result=true %}


Usage
-----

### Filling
An empty florb can be filled with a
[bucket](https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Bucket) worth of fluid using a [fluid
transposer](/docs/thermal-expansion/fluid-transposer/) or similar. Florbs can only hold fluids
that can be placed as blocks using buckets.

A florb cannot hold hot fluids like
[lava](https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Lava). These fluids can only be put into
[magmatic florbs](/docs/thermal-expansion/magmatic-florb/).

### Throwing
A filled florb can be thrown by using it. On impact, it releases the fluid it
holds into the world.

Florbs that contain fluids that are lighter than air, like [energized
glowstone](/docs/thermal-foundation/energized-glowstone/) and [zephyrean
aerotheum](/docs/thermal-foundation/zephyrean-aerotheum/), can be thrown further.
