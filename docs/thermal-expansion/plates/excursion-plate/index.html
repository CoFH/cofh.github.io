<p>The <strong>Excursion Plate</strong> is one of the Plates added by Thermal Expansion. It is an upgraded version of the <a href="/docs/thermal-expansion/plates/impulse-plate/">Impulse Plate</a>. It uses <a href="/docs/redstone-flux">Redstone Flux</a> to project a beam of force which moves entities in a certain direction, defying gravity. The beam has a configurable maximum length, and dissipates when far enough from the Plate.</p>

<p>The Plate can be placed on any side of a block. Its beam normally moves entities away from the Plate, but it can be configured to pull entities towards itself instead, or to switch between the two according to a Redstone signal.</p>

<h2 id="power">Power</h2>
<p>The Excursion Plate consumes energy whenever possible to project its beam. The amount of RF/t consumed is equal to the length in blocks of the Plate's beam; for example, the Plate uses 20 RF/t when the projected beam is 20 blocks long. The Plate can store 200000 RF internally.</p>

<h2 id="gui">GUI</h2>
<p>The Excursion Plate can be configured by sneaking and using a <a href="/docs/thermal-expansion/tools/multimeter/">Multimeter</a> on it. The Plate's GUI is then opened:</p>

<dl class="uk-description-list-line">
    <dt>1. Energy Gauge</dt>
    <dd>Displays how much Redstone Flux is currently stored in the Excursion Plate.</dd>

    <dt>2. Distance Controls</dt>
    <dd>Change the length in blocks of the Excursion Plate's beam. Can be anywhere between 1 and 26 blocks.</dd>
    
    <dt>3. Information Tab</dt>
    <dd>Displays a bit of information about the Excursion Plate.</dd>

    <dt>4. Redstone Control Tab</dt>
    <dd>Allows setting how the Excursion Plate responds to Redstone signals. Note that the Excursion Plate cannot be disabled by Redstone signals; they can only reverse the direction of the Plate's beam.</dd>
    
    <dt>5. Security Tab</dt>
    <dd>Allows setting who is allowed to configure the Excursion Plate. Only available if a <a href="/docs/thermal-expansion/materials/signalum-security-lock/">Signalum Security Lock</a> is installed.</dd>
