<p>The <strong>Translocation Plate</strong> is one of the Plates added by Thermal Expansion. When touched by entities, it teleports them a configurable amount of blocks away from the Plate in a certain direction. This works even when there are other blocks in between; in other words, the Translocation Plate works through walls. However, it doesn't work if the destination itself is blocked.</p>

<p>The Plate can be placed on any side of a block. Its initial direction depends on which part of the face the player is aiming at when placing the Plate. For example, aiming at the middle of the face results in a Plate pointed away from the block the Plate is placed on, and aiming slightly to the west results in a Plate pointed to the west.</p>

<p>The direction of the Plate can be changed using a <a href="/docs/thermal-expansion/tools/crescent-hammer/">Crescent Hammer</a> or similar, as well as in the Plate's GUI.</p>

<p>The Translocation Plate can be configured by sneaking and using a <a href="/docs/thermal-expansion/tools/multimeter/">Multimeter</a> on it. The Plate's GUI is then opened:</p>
