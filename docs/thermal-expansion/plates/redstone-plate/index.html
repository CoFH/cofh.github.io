<p>The <strong>Redstone Plate</strong> is one of the Plates added by Thermal Expansion. When touched by an entity, it places a temporary block that emits a Redstone signal at a configurable amount of blocks in a certain direction from the Plate. This works even when there are other blocks in between; in other words, the Redstone Plate works through walls.</p>

<p>The temporary block is mostly invisible, but it does emit red particles. The amount of time until the temporary block is removed is configurable.</p>

<p>The Plate can be placed on any side of a block. Its initial direction depends on which part of the face the player is aiming at when placing the Plate. For example, aiming at the middle of the face results in a Plate pointed away from the block the Plate is placed on, and aiming slightly to the west results in a Plate pointed to the west.</p>

<p>The direction of the Plate can be changed using a <a href="/docs/thermal-expansion/tools/crescent-hammer/">Crescent Hammer</a> or similar, as well as in the Plate's GUI.</p>

<p>The Redstone Plate can be configured by sneaking and using a <a href="/docs/thermal-expansion/tools/multimeter/">Multimeter</a> on it. The Plate's GUI is then opened:</p>
