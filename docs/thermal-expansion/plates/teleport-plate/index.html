<p>The <strong>Teleport Plate</strong> is one of the Plates added by Thermal Expansion. It is an upgraded version of the <a href="/docs/thermal-expansion/plates/translocation-plate/">Translocation Plate</a>. It uses large amounts of <a href="/docs/redstone-flux">Redstone Flux</a> to teleport entities that touch it to another Teleport Plate. This works across large distances and even between dimensions.</p>

<p>A Teleport Plate can be set as a source that links to another Teleport Plate, a destination for other Teleport Plates to link to, or both. When a Teleport Plate is set as a source, it emits small beams that indicate this.</p>

<p>The Plate can be placed on any side of a block. Living entities need to touch the Plate for a few seconds before being teleported, similarly to how Nether Portals work. However, other kinds of entities like dropped items are teleported instantly.</p>

<h2 id="energy">Energy</h2>
<p>The Teleport Plate consumes 100,000 RF to teleport entities by default, or 1000,000 RF when teleporting across dimensions. When teleporting dropped items, the value is divided by 1000. Lastly, teleporting Endermen costs twice as much energy, due to the Plate having to override their natural teleporting abilities.</p>

<p>The Plate can store 2000,000 RF internally. It refuses to teleport entities if insufficient energy is stored in it.</p>

<h2 id="gui">GUI</h2>
<p>The Teleport Plate can be configured by sneaking and using a <a href="/docs/thermal-expansion/tools/multimeter/">Multimeter</a> on it. The Plate's GUI is then opened:</p>

<dl class="uk-description-list-line">
    <dt>1. Energy Gauge</dt>
    <dd>Displays how much Redstone Flux is currently stored in the Teleport Plate.</dd>

    <dt>2. Name Field</dt>
    <dd>Allows assigning a name to the Teleport Plate. This name is used to identify the Plate as a destination. </dd>

    <dt>3. Enable Button</dt>
    <dd>Saves the Teleport Plate's name as specified in the Name Field. This makes the Plate available as a destination for other Teleport Plates to link to.</dd>

    <dt>4. Disable Button</dt>
    <dd>Removes the Teleport Plate's name, disabling it as a destination for other Teleport Plates.</dd>

    <dt>5. Destination Field</dt>
    <dd>Displays the name of the Teleport Plate's current destination, or the currently selected destination from the Destination List to set the Plate to link to.</dd>

    <dt>6. Destination Set Button</dt>
    <dd>Sets the Teleport Plate's destination to the currently selected item in the Destination List, as displayed in the Destination Field.</dd>

    <dt>7. Destination Remove Button</dt>
    <dd>Unlinks the Teleport Plate from its current destination.</dd>

    <dt>8. Destination List</dt>
    <dd>Lists the names of all Teleport Plates that are available as destinations. Clicking on a name in the list selects it, so that the Plate may be linked to it. The name of the destination that the Plate is currently linked to is highlighted, if applicable.</dd>

    <dt>9. Information Tab</dt>
    <dd>Displays a bit of information about the Teleport Plate.</dd>

    <dt>10. Redstone Control Tab</dt>
    <dd>Allows setting when the Teleport Plate is enabled or disabled according to Redstone signals.</dd>

    <dt>11. Security Tab</dt>
    <dd>Allows setting who is allowed to configure as well as be teleported by the Teleport Plate. Also allows using restricted or private destinations, which are not publicly visible or usable. Only available if a <a href="/docs/thermal-expansion/materials/signalum-security-lock/">Signalum Security Lock</a> is installed.</dd>
