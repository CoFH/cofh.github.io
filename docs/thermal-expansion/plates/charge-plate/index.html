<p>The <strong>Charge Plate</strong> is one of the Plates added by Thermal Expansion. It is an upgraded version of the <a href="/docs/thermal-expansion/plates/redstone-plate/">Redstone Plate</a>. It charges <a href="/docs/redstone-flux/">Redstone Flux</a>-powered items held or worn by entities that touch it, as well as dropped items that touch it.</p>

<p>The Plate can be placed on any side of a block.</p>

<h2 id="power">Power</h2>
<p>The Charge Plate charges Redstone Flux-powered items at a maximum rate of 1000 RF/t. This rate may be limited by the charged items. The Plate can store 80000 RF internally. Unlike Machines, the Plate does not slow down if its internal energy storage is starting to deplete.</p>

<h2 id="gui">GUI</h2>
<p>The Charge Plate can be configured by sneaking and using a <a href="/docs/thermal-expansion/tools/multimeter/">Multimeter</a> on it. The Plate's GUI is then opened:</p>

<dl class="uk-description-list-line">
    <dt>1. Energy Gauge</dt>
    <dd>Displays how much Redstone Flux is currently stored in the Charge Plate.</dd>
    
    <dt>2. Item Charging Toggle Button</dt>
    <dd>Toggles the Charge Plate between charging dropped items as well as held or worn items (default) and charging only held or worn items.</dd>
    
    <dt>3. Information Tab</dt>
    <dd>Displays a bit of information about the Charge Plate.</dd>
    
    <dt>4. Security Tab</dt>
    <dd>Allows setting who is allowed to configure as well as have their items charged by the the Charge Plate. Only available if a <a href="/docs/thermal-expansion/materials/signalum-security-lock/">Signalum Security Lock</a> is installed.</dd>
