[Thermal Foundation](/docs/thermal-foundation/) adds recipes to obtain the new
[potions](/docs/cofh-core-potions/) added by [CoFH Core](/docs/cofh-core/).


Brewing
-------

Most [potions](/docs/cofh-core-potions/) added by [CoFH Core](/docs/cofh-core/)
can be [brewed](https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Brewing) by adding certain
ingredients to [awkward
potions](https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Potion#Base_potions).

| Potion | Ingredient |
|---
| Potion of Haste | [Basalz Powder](/docs/basalz-powder/) |
| Potion of Resistance | [Pulverized Obsidian](/docs/pulverized-obsidian/) |
| Potion of Levitation | [Blitz Powder](/docs/blitz-powder/) |
| Potion of Absorption | [Blizz Powder](/docs/blizz-powder/) |

Potions of decay can be brewed by adding a [fermented spider
eye](https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Fermented_Spider_Eye) to a [potion of
regeneration](https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Potion#Potion_of_Regeneration).

Like with other potions, [redstone](https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Redstone)
and [glowstone dust](https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Glowstone_Dust) can be
added to extend the duration and increase the strength of these potions,
respectively.
