Certain blocks and items added by the mods in the Thermal Series come in up to
six different **tiers**. They can be upgraded to higher tiers to make them more
powerful.


Upgrading
---------

Upgradable blocks are upgraded using [upgrade kits](/docs/thermal-foundation-2/upgrade-kits/) and
[conversion kits](/docs/thermal-foundation-2/conversion-kits/). Upgradable items are upgraded through
crafting recipes.

The following blocks and items can be upgraded:

* All [machines](/docs/thermal-expansion-5/machines/)
* All [dynamos](/docs/thermal-expansion-5/dynamos/)
* [Energy Cell](/docs/thermal-expansion-5/energy-cell/)
* [Flux Capacitor](/docs/thermal-expansion-5/flux-capacitor/)
* [Portable Tank](/docs/thermal-expansion-5/portable-tank/)
* [Reservoir](/docs/thermal-expansion-5/reservoir/)
* [Cache](/docs/thermal-expansion-5/cache/)
* [Strongbox](/docs/thermal-expansion-5/strongbox/)
* [Satchel](/docs/thermal-expansion-5/satchel/)
* [Watering Can](/docs/thermal-cultivation/watering-can/)
* [Fluxbore](/docs/thermal-innovation/fluxbore/)
* [Fluxomagnet](/docs/thermal-innovation/fluxomagnet/)
* [Hypoinfuser](/docs/thermal-innovation/hypoinfuser/)

Creative blocks and items are usually capable of things that are too powerful
for survival mode, but can be useful for testing or experimenting. For instance,
blocks and items that store things will provide an infinite amount of what they
store.

Placed creative blocks cannot be broken in survival mode. They can, however, be
dismantled with a [wrench](/docs/wrenches/).
