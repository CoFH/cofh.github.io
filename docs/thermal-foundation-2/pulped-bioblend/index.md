**Pulped bioblend** is a material obtained by mixing [pulped
biomass](/docs/thermal-foundation-2/pulped-biomass/) and
[sawdust](/docs/thermal-foundation-2/sawdust/). It can be processed into
[biocrude](/docs/thermal-foundation-2/biocrude/), which can then be processed into
[grassoline](/docs/thermal-foundation-2/grassoline/). Using bioblend allows for
more biocrude to be produced from the same amount of biomass.
