![Silver ore](/assets/images/thermal-foundation-2/ore-silver.png){:style="height: 128px"}


**Silver ore** is a somewhat uncommon [ore](https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Ore)
that yields [silver](/docs/thermal-foundation-2/silver-ingot/) and small amounts of
[lead](/docs/thermal-foundation-2/lead-ingot/).


Obtaining
---------

Silver ore is less common than [iron
ore](https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Iron_Ore), but more common than [gold
ore](https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Gold_Ore). It occurs at low levels in the
world (layers 5-30). Silver ore veins are slightly smaller than iron ore veins,
and may contain one or two blocks of [lead ore](/docs/thermal-foundation-2/lead-ore/) as well.
Similarly, lead ore veins may contain one or two blocks of silver ore.

Silver ore must be mined with an [iron
pickaxe](https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Pickaxe) or better. If it is mined, it
drops itself as an item.


Usage
-----

### Smelting
{% include recipe-table.html type='smelting' recipes=page.usage-recipes.smelting %}

### Crafting
{% include recipe-table.html type='crafting' recipes=page.usage-recipes.crafting %}

### Pulverizer
{% include recipe-table.html type='pulverizer-te5' recipes=page.usage-recipes.pulverizer %}

### Induction Smelter
{% include recipe-table.html type='smelter-te5' recipes=page.usage-recipes.smelter %}

### Smashing
When silver ore is broken using a [Smashing](/docs/cofh-core-4/smashing/)
enchanted [pickaxe](https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Pickaxe) or similar tool,
two piles of [pulverized silver](/docs/thermal-foundation-2/pulverized-silver/)
are dropped instead of the ore.

### Light source
Silver ore emits a light level of 4.


Trivia
------

* Silver ore is generated in the world using [CoFH World](/docs/cofh-world/) by
  default. The world generation can be tweaked or disabled using CoFH World's
  [configuration](/docs/cofh-world/world-generator-configuration/).
