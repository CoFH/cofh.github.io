**Mana dust** is a material that currently cannot be obtained.

Mana dust can currently only be used in an [insightful
condenser](/docs/thermal-expansion-5/insightful-condenser/), to increase the amount of [essence of
knowledge](/docs/thermal-foundation-2/essence-of-knowledge/) the device produces.
