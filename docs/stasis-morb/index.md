A **stasis morb** is a [morb](/docs/morb/) that can hold a specific
[mob](https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Mob) in stasis.

Usage
-----

A stasis morb works like a [reusable morb](/docs/reusable-morb/), except instead
of capturing the essence of a type of [mob](https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Mob)
and spawning a generic mob of that type, it captures and releases specific mobs.
For example, when a blue [sheep](https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Sheep) is
captured using a stasis morb, the same blue sheep is released when the morb is
thrown.
