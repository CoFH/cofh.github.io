A **fuel catalyzer** is an [augment](/docs/thermal-expansion-5/augments/) that increases the amount
of energy a [dynamo](/docs/thermal-expansion-5/dynamos/) generates from each unit of fuel.


Obtaining
---------

### Crafting
{% include recipe-table.html type='crafting' recipes=page.recipes.crafting no-result=true %}


Usage
-----

### Installation
A fuel catalyzer can be installed in the Augmentation tab in a
[dynamo](/docs/thermal-expansion-5/dynamos/)'s GUI. It can be installed multiple times, stacking its
effects.

### Effects
Installed fuel catalyzers increase the amount of energy a
[dynamo](/docs/thermal-expansion-5/dynamos/) generates from each unit of fuel.

| 1 | + 15% |

| 5 | + 75% |

</div>
{::options parse_block_html="false" /}

If fuel catalyzers are installed together with other augments that affect the
amount of energy generated from each unit of fuel, their energy
increase/decrease percentages are added together before being applied to the
amount of energy.
