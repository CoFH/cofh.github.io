A **flux reconstruction** [augment](/docs/thermal-expansion-5/augments/) allows for an [energetic
infuser](/docs/thermal-expansion-5/energetic-infuser/) to repair damaged items using [essence of
knowledge](/docs/thermal-foundation-2/essence-of-knowledge/).


Obtaining
---------

### Crafting
{% include recipe-table.html type='crafting' recipes=page.recipes.crafting no-result=true %}


Usage
-----

### Installation
A flux reconstruction augment can be installed in the Augmentation tab in an
[energetic infuser](/docs/thermal-expansion-5/energetic-infuser/)'s GUI. It is a specialization that
cannot be installed together with other specialization augments.

### Effects
An [energetic infuser](/docs/thermal-expansion-5/energetic-infuser/) with flux reconstruction
installed repairs damaged items instead of charging items with [Redstone
Flux](/docs/redstone-flux/). It uses 500 RF and 5 mB of [essence of
knowledge](/docs/thermal-foundation-2/essence-of-knowledge/) per restored durability point.
