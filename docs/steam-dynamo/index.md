A **steam dynamo** is a [dynamo](/docs/dynamos/) fueled by
[steam](/docs/steam/), which is produced internally using
[water](https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Water) and solid fuel.


Obtaining
---------

A placed steam dynamo can be instantly picked up by dismantling it with a
[crescent hammer](/docs/crescent-hammer/). Its configuration is preserved in the
item. It can also be mined using a
[pickaxe](https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Pickaxe), though this can be much
slower.

### Crafting
{% include recipe-table.html type='crafting' recipes=page.recipes.crafting no-result=true %}

### Upgrading
A steam dynamo is initially at the lowest [tier](#tiers) (basic). It can be
upgraded to higher tiers using [upgrade kits](/docs/upgrade-kits/) and
[conversion kits](/docs/conversion-kits/).


Usage
-----

### Placement
When placed, a steam dynamo faces up. If an adjacent block accepts [Redstone
Flux](/docs/redstone-flux/), the dynamo will face that block instead. A steam
dynamo can face any direction, and can be rotated using a [crescent
hammer](/docs/crescent-hammer/) or similar.

### Energy generation
A steam dynamo has a fuel slot and a
[water](https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Water) tank. When [fuel](#fuels) is
placed in its fuel slot and the tank is filled with water, the dynamo will start
consuming both to generate [Redstone Flux](/docs/redstone-flux/). Every unit of
fuel yields a certain amount of energy when consumed. Water is consumed in
batches of 100 mB to generate 25,000 RF at a time.

The speed at which energy is generated depends on how much power can be emitted,
and on the dynamo's maximum power output. A basic steam dynamo has a maximum
power output of 40 RF/t. This can be increased by upgrading the dynamo to a
higher [tier](#tiers), and by installing certain [augments](#augmentation).

When an active steam dynamo cannot emit the energy it generates, it will keep
working at its minimum power output (a tenth of its maximum power output). Any
more energy that is generated in this case is lost. This can be resolved by
installing an [excitation field
limiter](/docs/augment-excitation-field-limiter/).

### Input and output
A steam dynamo emits [Redstone Flux](/docs/redstone-flux/) from its coil, which
points in the direction the dynamo is facing. It only emits energy when it is
active. Fuel and water can enter a steam dynamo through its sides. They cannot
enter it through the coil, unless [transmission coil
ducting](/docs/augment-transmission-coil-ducting/) is installed.

### Redstone control
A steam dynamo may be configured to respond to
[redstone](https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Redstone) signals. It can be in one
of three modes:

Ignored
: Redstone control is disabled. The dynamo works whenever possible. This is the
default mode.

Low
: The dynamo works when *not* powered. When powered, it stops working.

High
: The dynamo only works when powered.

The current mode can be set using the Redstone Control tab in the machine's GUI.

When a steam dynamo must stop working due to a redstone signal and is still
generating energy from a consumed unit of fuel, it will finish generating energy
from that unit of fuel before stopping.

### Security
A steam dynamo can have a [signalum security
lock](/docs/signalum-security-lock/) installed to restrict who can access it.

### Redprints
A steam dynamo's configuration can be saved on a [redprint](/docs/redprint/) to
be copied to other dynamos.

### Light source
When a steam dynamo that produces [Redstone Flux](/docs/redstone-flux/) is
active, it emits a light level of 7.


Tiers
-----

Steam dynamos come in six [tiers](/docs/tiers/).

{::options parse_block_html="false" /}


Augmentation
------------

A steam dynamo can have [augments](/docs/augments/) installed to improve certain
properties or to change how it works. The amount of augments that can be
installed depends on the dynamo's [tier](#tiers). A basic steam dynamo cannot be
augmented.

Augments can be installed in the Augmentation tab in a steam dynamo's GUI.

{% include augment-table.html augments=page.augments %}


Fuels
-----

A steam dynamo accepts all items that can be used as fuel in a
[furnace](https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Furnace), except for those that leave
items in a furnace's fuel slot after being consumed, like [lava
buckets](https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Lava_Bucket).

| Fuel | Energy per unit |
|---
| [Coal](https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Coal) | 24,000 RF |
| [Block of Coal](https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Block_of_Coal) | 240,000 RF |
| [Charcoal](https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Charcoal) | 16,000 RF |
| [Coal Coke](/docs/coal-coke/) | 40,000 RF |
| Any other [furnace](https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Furnace) fuel | (Burn time in ticks Ã— 10) RF
