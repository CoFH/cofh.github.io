A **flurry stratum** is an [augment](/docs/augments/) that allows for a [glacial
precipitator](/docs/glacial-precipitator/) to produce [snow
layers](https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Snow_(layer)) instead of [snow
blocks](https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Snow).


Obtaining
---------

### Crafting
{% include recipe-table.html type='crafting' recipes=page.recipes.crafting no-result=true %}


Usage
-----

### Installation
A flurry stratum can be installed in the Augmentation tab in a [glacial
precipitator](/docs/glacial-precipitator/)'s GUI. It is a specialization that
cannot be installed together with other specialization augments.

### Effects
An installed flurry stratum replaces a [glacial
precipitator](/docs/glacial-precipitator/)'s ability to produce one [snow
block](https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Snow) at a time with the ability to
produce two [snow layers](https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Snow_(layer)) at a
time.
