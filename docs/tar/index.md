**Tar** is a byproduct of processing [oil sand](/docs/oil-sand/) in a
[pulverizer](/docs/pulverizer/), and of processing [liquifacted
coal](/docs/liquifacted-coal/) or [crude oil](/docs/crude-oil/) in a
[fractionating still](/docs/fractionating-still/). It can be used to craft
[torches](https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Torches), and can replace
[slimeballs](https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Slimeball) in some recipes. It can
also be processed into [creosote oil](/docs/creosote-oil/).
