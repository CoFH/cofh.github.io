**Hardened glass** is a hard to break and explosion resistant version of
[glass](https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Glass). Variants of hardened glass exist
for every type of metal that Thermal Foundation provides.


Obtaining
---------

Hardened glass can only be harvested by dismantling it with a
[wrench](/docs/wrenches/) or by breaking it with a [Silk
Touch](https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Silk_Touch) enchanted pickaxe.

### Induction Smelter
{% include recipe-table.html type='smelter' recipes=page.recipes.smelter %}


Usage
-----

### Light source
Some variants of hardened glass emit varying amounts of light depending on the
type of metal, like [lumium](/docs/lumium-ingot/).

### Wither proofing
Hardened glass blocks cannot be broken by
[withers](https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Wither).

### Beacons
Like [stained glass](https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Stained_Glass), hardened
glass blocks change the color of
[beacon](https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Beacon) beams that pass through them.

### Crafting ingredient
