A **trivection chamber** is an [augment](/docs/augments/) that doubles the
amount of cooked [food](https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Food) a [redstone
furnace](/docs/redstone-furnace/) produces when processing raw food.


Obtaining
---------

### Crafting
{% include recipe-table.html type='crafting' recipes=page.recipes.crafting no-result=true %}


Usage
-----

### Installation
A trivection chamber can be installed in the Augmentation tab in a [redstone
furnace](/docs/redstone-furnace/)'s GUI. It is a specialization that cannot be
installed together with other specialization augments.

### Effects
An installed trivection chamber replaces a [redstone
furnace](/docs/redstone-furnace/)'s recipe set with [its own](#recipes). This
recipe set consists only of cooking
[food](https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Food), though with double the amount of
output.
