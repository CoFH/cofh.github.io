A **trivection chamber** is an [augment](/docs/augments/) that doubles the
amount of cooked [food](https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Food) a [redstone
furnace](/docs/redstone-furnace/) produces when processing raw food.

### Crafting

Usage
-----

### Installation
A trivection chamber can be installed in the Augmentation tab in a [redstone
furnace](/docs/redstone-furnace/)'s GUI. It is a specialization that cannot be
installed together with other specialization augments.

### Effects
A [redstone furnace](/docs/redstone-furnace/) with a trivection chamber
installed processes each unit of raw
[food](https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Food) into two units of cooked food. For
example, one raw [potato](https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Potato) is processed
into two [baked potatoes](https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Baked_Potato).
However, the machine cannot process anything other than food, and the amount of
energy required per operation is increased by 50%.

If a trivection chamber is installed together with other augments that increase
the amount of energy required per operation, their energy increase percentages
are added together before being applied to the amount of energy.
