A **signalum-plated fluiduct** is a type of [fluiduct](/docs/thermal-dynamics/fluiduct/) that
transfers both fluids and [Redstone Flux](/docs/redstone-flux/).


Obtaining
---------

### Crafting
{% include recipe-table.html type='crafting' recipes=page.recipes.crafting %}


Usage
-----

### Fluid and energy transfer
A signalum-plated fluiduct works the same way as a [hardened
fluiduct](/docs/thermal-dynamics/hardened-fluiduct/). However, it also transfers [Redstone
Flux](/docs/redstone-flux/) like a [fluxduct](/docs/thermal-dynamics/fluxducts/), at up to 4,000
RF/t per connection.
