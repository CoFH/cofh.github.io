A **resonant fluxduct** is a [fluxduct](/docs/fluxducts/) of the fifth tier. It
could be considered the highest 'regular' tier, due to the different behavior of
[cryo-stabilized fluxducts](/docs/cryo-stabilized-fluxduct/).


Obtaining
---------

### Crafting
{% include recipe-table.html type='crafting' recipes=page.recipes.crafting %}

### Fluid Transposer
{% include recipe-table.html type='transposer-fill' recipes=page.recipes.transposer-fill %}


Usage
-----

### Energy transfer
A resonant fluxduct works the same way as most other
[fluxducts](/docs/fluxducts/). It transfers up to 25,000 RF/t per connection.
