A **cryo-stabilized fluxduct** is a [fluxduct](/docs/fluxducts/) of the sixth
and highest tier. It can transfer any amount of power.


Obtaining
---------

### Crafting
{% include recipe-table.html type='crafting' recipes=page.recipes.crafting %}

### Fluid Transposer
{% include recipe-table.html type='transposer-fill' recipes=page.recipes.transposer-fill %}


Usage
-----

### Energy transfer
A cryo-stabilized fluxduct works mostly the same way as other
[fluxducts](/docs/fluxducts/). However, it can transfer an unlimited amount of
[Redstone Flux](/docs/redstone-flux/) per tick. A network of cryo-stabilized
fluxducts also does not store any energy.
