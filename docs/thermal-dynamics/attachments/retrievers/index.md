**Retrievers** are attachments added by Thermal Dynamics. Retrievers can be
attached to [Itemducts](/docs/thermal-dynamics/ducts/itemducts/) or
[Fluiducts](/docs/thermal-dynamics/ducts/fluiducts/).

Depending on the duct the retriever is attached to the retriever can extract
items or fluids from other inventories to itself.

There are several types of retrievers that unlocks more features.
