**Fluxducts** are blocks added by Thermal Dynamics. They transport [Redstone
Flux](/docs/redstone-flux/) between blocks that can store, generate or use RF.
There are several types of Fluxducts, they can double as an
[Itemduct](/docs/thermal-dynamics/ducts/itemducts/), or a
[Fluiduct](/docs/thermal-dynamics/ducts/fluiducts/).

Every type of Fluxduct has a limit on how much energy it can transport.
