**Fluxducts** are blocks added by Thermal Dynamics. They transport [Redstone Flux](/docs/redstone-flux/about/redstone-flux-a-primer/) between blocks that can store, generate or use RF. There are several types of Fluxducts, they can double as an [Itemduct](/docs/thermal-dynamics/ducts/itemducts/), or a [Fluiduct](/docs/thermal-dynamics/ducts/fluiducts/).

Every type of Fluxduct has a limit on how much energy it can transport.
