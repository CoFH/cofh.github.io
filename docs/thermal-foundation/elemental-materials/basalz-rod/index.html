<p><strong>Basalz Rods</strong> are mob drops added by Thermal Foundation. They are sometimes dropped when a <a href="/docs/thermal-foundation/mobs/basalz">Basalz</a> is killed. Essentially, they are the Basalz equivalent of Blaze Rods.</p>

<h2 id="usage">Usage</h2>
<p>Basalz Rods only have a single use: they can be crafted or <a href="/docs/thermal-expansion/machines/pulverizer">pulverized</a> into <a href="/docs/thermal-foundation/elemental-materials/basalz-powder">Basalz Powder</a>. This material is a critical ingredient for creating <a href="/docs/thermal-foundation/elemental-materials/petrotheum-dust">Petrotheum Dust</a> and, ultimately, <a href="/docs/thermal-foundation/fluids/tectonic-petrotheum">Tectonic Petrotheum</a>.</p>
