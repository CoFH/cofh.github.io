<p>
    This page describes the various ores that Thermal Foundation generates in the world. It also describes where they can be found and what they can be used for.
</p>

<p>
    <strong>Note:</strong> It is easy to <a href="/docs/cofh-core/custom-world-generation.html">change the way Thermal Foundation generates its ores</a>. This page will only describe how the ores generate using the default settings. If you are using a customized modpack, this may not be accurate!
</p>

<p>
    For the more technical people, have a look at the <a href="http://pastebin.com/ZXWrcQyE" target="_blank">default <dfn>ThermalFoundation-Ores.json</dfn> file</a> to see the exact details of how each ore can generate.

<h2 id="copper-ore">Copper Ore</h2>
<img src="/assets/images/thermal-foundation/copper-ore.png" />

<p>Copper generates near the surface, at Y levels 40 to 75. Copper Ore is quite common, with ten possible regular-sized clusters per chunk. Additional amounts of Copper Ore may be found at Y levels 48 to 96, with another eight possible clusters. When processed properly, it yields <a href="/docs/thermal-foundation/materials/copper.html">Copper</a> and trace amounts of <a href="/docs/thermal-foundation/vanilla-materials/gold.html">Gold.</a><br />
Copper Ore has a harvest level of 1, which means that a Stone Pickaxe or better is required to mine it.</p>

<h2 id="tin-ore">Tin Ore</h2>
<img src="/assets/images/thermal-foundation/tin-ore.png" />

<p>This ore generates somewhat deep underground at Y levels 20 to 55. Tin Ore is a little less common than <a href="#copper-ore">Copper Ore</a>, with eight possible regular-sized clusters per chunk. When processed properly, it yields <a href="/docs/thermal-foundation/materials/tin.html">Tin</a> and trace amounts of <a href="/docs/thermal-foundation/vanilla-materials/iron.html">Iron</a>.<br />
Tin Ore has a harvest level of 1, which means that a Stone Pickaxe or better is required to mine it.</p>

<h2 id="silver-ore">Silver Ore</h2>
<img src="/assets/images/thermal-foundation/silver-ore.png" />

<p>Silver generates deep underground at Y levels 5 to 30. Silver Ore is somewhat uncommon, with six possible regular-sized clusters per chunk. The clusters commonly also contain some <a href="#lead-ore">Lead Ore</a>. When processed properly, it yields <a href="/docs/thermal-foundation/materials/silver.html">Silver</a> and trace amounts of <a href="/docs/thermal-foundation/materials/lead.html">Lead.</a><br />
Silver Ore has a harvest level of 2, which means that an Iron Pickaxe or better is required to mine it.</p>

<h2 id="lead-ore">Lead Ore</h2>
<img src="/assets/images/thermal-foundation/lead-ore.png" />

<p>Lead Ore generates slightly less deep underground than Silver Ore, at Y levels 10 to 35. The ore is somewhat common, with eight possible regular-sized clusters per chunk. The clusters may also contain a bit of <a href="#silver-ore">Silver Ore</a>. When processed properly, it yields <a href="/docs/thermal-foundation/materials/lead.html">Lead</a> and trace amounts of <a href="/docs/thermal-foundation/materials/silver.html">Silver</a>.<br />
Lead Ore has a harvest level of 2, which means that an Iron Pickaxe or better is required to mine it.</p>

<h2 id="ferrous-ore">Ferrous Ore</h2>
<img src="/assets/images/thermal-foundation/ferrous-ore.png" />

<p>This rare ore generates deep underground, at Y levels 5 to 20. Ferrous Ore is pretty rare, with three possible small clusters per chunk. When processed properly, it yields <a href="/docs/thermal-foundation/materials/ferrous-metal.html">Ferrous Metal</a> and trace amounts of <a href="/docs/thermal-foundation/materials/shiny-metal.html">Shiny Metal</a>.<br />
Ferrous Ore has a harvest level of 2, which means that an Iron Pickaxe or better is required to mine it.</p>

<h2 id="shiny-ore">Shiny Ore</h2>
<img src="/assets/images/thermal-foundation/shiny-ore.png" />

<p>Shiny Ore very rarely generates deep underground, at Y levels 5 to 30. The ore is quite rare, with only one possible small cluster per chunk. On top of that, only 1 in 3 attempts to generate a cluster will actually succeed. The clusters can also contain a bit of <a href="#ferrous-ore">Ferrous Ore</a>. When processed properly, it yields <a href="/docs/thermal-foundation/materials/shiny-metal.html">Shiny Metal</a>.<br />
Shiny Ore has a harvest level of 2, which means that an Iron Pickaxe or better is required to mine it.</p>

<h2 id="mana-infused-ore">Mana Infused Ore</h2>
<img src="/assets/images/thermal-foundation/mana-infused-ore.png" />

<p>
    Mana Infused Ore is a mysterious substance that pulses with magical energy. Trace amounts of it sometimes inexplicably appear in advanced laser-powered mining installations. Adventurers brave enough to venture into the Nether have also reported seeing the strange metal in tiny veins throughout the hellish dimension.<br />
    Very little is known about this ore, as an efficient way of obtaining it has not been discovered yet.

<h2 id="vanilla-ores">Vanilla Ores</h2>
<img class="uk-margin-small-bottom" src="/assets/images/thermal-foundation/gold-ore.png" title="Gold Ore" /> 
<img class="uk-margin-small-bottom" src="/assets/images/thermal-foundation/redstone-ore.png" title="Redstone Ore" /> 
<img class="uk-margin-small-bottom"src="/assets/images/thermal-foundation/iron-ore.png" title="Iron Ore" /> 
<img class="uk-margin-small-bottom" src="/assets/images/thermal-foundation/nether-quartz-ore.png" title="Nether Quartz Ore" />

<p>Ores from vanilla Minecraft may be processed as well, with some yielding additional results other than their main products. When processed properly, Gold Ore and Redstone Ore may yield <a href="/docs/thermal-foundation/materials/cinnabar.html">Cinnabar</a>, Iron Ore may yield <a href="/docs/thermal-foundation/materials/ferrous-metal.html">Ferrous Metal</a>, and Nether Quartz Ore may yield <a href="/docs/thermal-foundation/materials/sulfur.html">Sulfur</a>.</p>
