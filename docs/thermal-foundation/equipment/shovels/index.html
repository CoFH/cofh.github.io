{% include tftoolimages.html type='shovel' %}

<p><strong>Shovels</strong> are tools that are commonly used in Minecraft. They are used to dig up Dirt, Sand, Gravel and other similar blocks. Thermal Foundation adds Shovel types for all of its base metals and some of its alloys.</p>

<p>Shovels can be repaired with an Anvil, using the metals they are crafted with.</p>
