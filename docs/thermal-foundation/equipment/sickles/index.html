{% include tftoolimages.html type='sickle' %}

<p><strong>Sickles</strong> are tools that can be used for harvesting crops quickly. When a plant-type block is broken using a Sickle, all plant-type blocks in a 7-by-7-block area are broken as well. Thermal Foundation adds Sickle types for all of its base metals and some of its alloys.</p>

<p>Sickles can be repaired with an Anvil, using the metals they are crafted with.</p>
