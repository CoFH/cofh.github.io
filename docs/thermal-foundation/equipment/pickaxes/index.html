{% include tftoolimages.html type='pickaxe' %}

<p><strong>Pickaxes</strong> are some of the most commonly used tools in Minecraft. They are used to break Stone and stone-like blocks as well as ores. Thermal Foundation adds Pickaxe types for all of its base metals and some of its alloys.</p>

<p>Pickaxes can be repaired with an Anvil, using the metals they are crafted with.</p>
