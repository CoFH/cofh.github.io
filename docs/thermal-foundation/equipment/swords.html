{% include tftoolimages.html type='sword' %}

<p><strong>Swords</strong> are very commonly used weapons in Minecraft. They are mostly used to deal melee damage to entities, but can also be used for breaking plant-like blocks and cobwebs a bit faster than by hand. Thermal Foundation adds Sword types for all of its base metals and some of its alloys.</p>

<p>Swords can be repaired with an Anvil, using the metals they are crafted with. They are also able to block attacks by holding the <i>use</i> button. This will reduce damage dealt by most attacks by 50%, and will reduce the player to a speed slower than sneaking.</p>

<h2>Enchantments</h2>
<p>
    Swords can have the following enchantments applied to them:
    <ul>
        <li>Fire Aspect</li>
        <li>Looting</li>
        <li>Unbreaking</li>
        <li>Knockback</li>
        <li>Sharpness*</li>
        <li>Smite*</li>
        <li>Bane of Arthropods*</li>
    </ul>
    <span class="uk-text-small">*: An Sword cannot have Sharpness, Smite and Bane of Arthropods on it at the same time.</span>
</p>

<h2>Comparison</h2>
