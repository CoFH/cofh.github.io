<p><strong>Fishing Rods</strong> are tools that can be used for fishing. Thermal Foundation adds reinforced versions of the Fishing Rod from vanilla Minecraft, made with any of its base metals and some of its alloys. Apart from durability and enchantability, they work pretty much the same as their vanilla counterpart.</p>

<p>Fishing Rods can be repaired with an Anvil, using the metals they are crafted with.</p>
