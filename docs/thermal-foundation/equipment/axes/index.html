{% include tftoolimages.html type='axe' %}

<p><strong>Axes</strong> are tools that are commonly used in Minecraft. They are used to break wooden blocks faster than by hand. Thermal Foundation adds Axe types for all of its base metals and some of its alloys.</p>

<p>Axes can be repaired with an Anvil, using the metals they are crafted with. Axes added by Thermal Foundation also differ slightly from Axes in vanilla Minecraft, in that they can break Melon and Cactus blocks faster than by hand.</p>

<h2>Enchantments</h2>
<p>
    Axes can have the following enchantments applied to them:
    <ul>
        <li>Efficiency</li>
        <li>Unbreaking</li>
        <li>Silk Touch*</li>
        <li>Fortune*</li>
    </ul>
    <span class="uk-text-small">*: An Axe cannot have both Silk Touch and Fortune on it.</span>
</p>

<h2>Comparison</h2>
