<p><strong>Reinforced Bows</strong> are ranged weapons that can be used to fire arrows. Thermal Foundation adds reinforced versions of the Bow from vanilla Minecraft, made with any of its base metals and some of its alloys. Reinforced Bows work nearly the same as their vanilla counterpart, with a few small differences.</p>

<p>Reinforced Bows can be repaired with an Anvil, using the metals they are crafted with.</p>
