{% include tftoolimages.html type='pickaxe' %}

<p><strong>Pickaxes</strong> are some of the most commonly used tools in Minecraft. They are used to break Stone and stone-like blocks as well as ores. Thermal Foundation adds Pickaxe types for all of its base metals and some of its alloys.</p>

<p>Pickaxes can be repaired with an Anvil, using the metals they are crafted with.</p>

<h2>Enchantments</h2>
<p>
    Pickaxes can have the following enchantments applied to them:
    <ul>
        <li>Efficiency</li>
        <li>Unbreaking</li>
        <li>Silk Touch*</li>
        <li>Fortune*</li>
    </ul>
    <span class="uk-text-small">*: A Pickaxe cannot have both Silk Touch and Fortune on it.</span>
</p>

<h2>Comparison</h2>
<p>This table shows the differences between the various Pickaxes provided by Thermal Foundation. Pickaxes from vanilla Minecraft and the <a href="/docs/redstone-arsenal/equipment/flux-infused-pickaxe.html">Flux-Infused Pickaxe</a> from <a href="/docs/redstone-arsenal">Redstone Arsenal</a> are also included for comparison.</p>
