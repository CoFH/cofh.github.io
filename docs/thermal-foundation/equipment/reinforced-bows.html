<p><strong>Reinforced Bows</strong> are ranged weapons that can be used to fire arrows. Thermal Foundation adds reinforced versions of the Bow from vanilla Minecraft, made with any of its base metals and some of its alloys. Reinforced Bows work nearly the same as their vanilla counterpart, with a few small differences.</p>

<p>Reinforced Bows can be repaired with an Anvil, using the metals they are crafted with.</p>

<h2>Enchantments</h2>
<p>
    Bows can have the following enchantments applied to them:
    <ul>
        <li>Power</li>
        <li>Punch</li>
        <li>Flame</li>
        <li>Infinity*</li>
        <li>Unbreaking</li>
        <li><a href="/docs/cofh-core/enchantments/multishot.html">Multishot</a>**</li>
    </ul>
    <span class="uk-text-small">*: Unlike Bows from vanilla Minecraft, Reinforced Bows do not require a single arrow to be in the player's inventory for this.</span><br />
    <span class="uk-text-small">**: Does not work properly on Bows from vanilla Minecraft.</span>
</p>
