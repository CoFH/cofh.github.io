{% include tftoolimages.html type='shears' %}

<p><strong>Shears</strong> are tools with specific uses in Minecraft. They can be used to obtain Wool from Sheep, harvest plants and Cobwebs, and to disarm Tripwire traps. Thermal Foundation adds Shears types for all of its base metals and some of its alloys.</p>

<p>Shears can be repaired with an Anvil, using the metals they are crafted with.</p>
