{% include tftoolimages.html type='sword' %}

<p><strong>Swords</strong> are very commonly used weapons in Minecraft. They are mostly used to deal melee damage to entities, but can also be used for breaking plant-like blocks and cobwebs a bit faster than by hand. Thermal Foundation adds Sword types for all of its base metals and some of its alloys.</p>

<p>Swords can be repaired with an Anvil, using the metals they are crafted with. They are also able to block attacks by holding the <i>use</i> button. This will reduce damage dealt by most attacks by 50%, and will reduce the player to a speed slower than sneaking.</p>
