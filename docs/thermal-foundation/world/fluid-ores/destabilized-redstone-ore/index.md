**Destabilized redstone ore** is a rare
[ore](https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Ore).


Obtaining
---------
Destabilized redstone ore is relatively rare. It occurs underground at around
the same levels as [redstone ore](https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Redstone_Ore)
(layers 0-20). It occurs in fairly large deposits, almost as large as deposits
of [coal ore](https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Coal_Ore). Deposits of
destabilized redstone ore may also contain some [destabilized
redstone](/docs/thermal-foundation/fluids/molten/destabilized-redstone/).

Destabilized redstone ore must be mined with a [stone
pickaxe](https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Pickaxe) or better. It drops one piece
of [destabilized
clathrate](/docs/thermal-foundation/items/materials/other/destabilized-clathrate/)
when mined. More clathrate is dropped if a
[Fortune](https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Fortune) enchanted pickaxe is used.
The ore block itself can be obtained by mining it with a [Silk
Touch](https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Silk_Touch) enchanted pickaxe.

When destabilized redstone ore is broken, some [destabilized
redstone](/docs/thermal-foundation/fluids/molten/destabilized-redstone/) comes
flowing out. This fluid cannot be picked up and eventually disappears.
