**Oil shale** is an uncommon [ore](https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Ore).


Obtaining
---------
Oil shale occurs fairly uncommonly in
[mesas](https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Mesa),
[oceans](https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Ocean),
[swamplands](https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Swampland), and snowy
[biomes](https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Biome) in veins between
[gravel](https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Gravel),
[dirt](https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Dirt) and
[stone](https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Stone) blocks. It is found at almost any
altitude (layers 10-80). It occurs in fairly large deposits, almost as large as
deposits of [coal ore](https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Coal_Ore). Deposits of
oil shale may also contain some coal ore.

Oil shale also more rarely occurs in much larger deposits underground (layers
20-60) in all biomes, surrounding a small amount of [crude
oil](/docs/thermal-foundation/fluids/crude-oil/).

Oil shale must be mined with a [stone
pickaxe](https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Pickaxe) or better. It drops one piece
of [bitumen](/docs/thermal-foundation/materials/bitumen/) when mined. More
bitumen is dropped if a [Fortune](https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Fortune)
enchanted pickaxe is used. Oil shale itself can be obtained by mining it with a
[Silk Touch](https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Silk_Touch) enchanted pickaxe.

When oil shale is broken, some [crude
oil](/docs/thermal-foundation/fluids/crude-oil/) comes flowing out. This oil
cannot be picked up and eventually disappears.
