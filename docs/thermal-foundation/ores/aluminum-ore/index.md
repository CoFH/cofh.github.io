**Aluminum ore** is an
[ore](https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Ore){:target="_blank"} that yields
[aluminum](/docs/thermal-foundation/metals-and-alloys/aluminum/).


Obtaining
---------
Aluminum ore does not occur in the world by default, and thus cannot be
legitimately obtained. However, it may be configured to generate in the world in
modpacks.

Aluminum ore must be mined with a [stone
pickaxe](https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Pickaxe){:target="_blank"} or better.
If it is mined, it drops itself as an item.


Usage
-----
Aluminum ore yields
[aluminum](/docs/thermal-foundation/metals-and-alloys/aluminum/) when processed.
If processed in a [pulverizer](/docs/thermal-expansion/machines/pulverizer/) or
an [induction smelter](/docs/thermal-expansion/machines/induction-smelter/), it
may also yield small amounts of
[iron](https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Iron){:target="_blank"}.
