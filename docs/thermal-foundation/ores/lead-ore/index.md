**Lead ore** is a somewhat uncommon
[ore](https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Ore){:target="_blank"} that yields
[lead](/docs/thermal-foundation/metals-and-alloys/lead/).


Obtaining
---------
Lead ore is less common than [iron
ore](https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Iron_Ore){:target="_blank"}, but more
common than [gold
ore](https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Gold_Ore){:target="_blank"}. It occurs at
relatively low levels in the world (layers 15-35). Lead ore veins are slightly
smaller than iron ore veins, and may contain one or two blocks of [silver
ore](/docs/thermal-foundation/ores/silver-ore/) as well. Similarly, silver ore
veins may contain one or two blocks of lead ore.

Lead ore must be mined with an [iron
pickaxe](https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Pickaxe){:target="_blank"} or better.
If it is mined, it drops itself as an item.


Usage
-----
Lead ore yields [lead](/docs/thermal-foundation/metals-and-alloys/lead/) when
processed, which is used to build various devices and to create
[enderium](/docs/thermal-foundation/metals-and-alloys/enderium/). If processed
in a [pulverizer](/docs/thermal-expansion/machines/pulverizer/) or an [induction
smelter](/docs/thermal-expansion/machines/induction-smelter/), it may also yield
small amounts of [silver](/docs/thermal-foundation/metals-and-alloys/silver/).
