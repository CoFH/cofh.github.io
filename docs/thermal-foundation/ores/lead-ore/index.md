**Lead ore** is a somewhat uncommon [ore](https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Ore).


Obtaining
---------
Lead ore is less common than [iron
ore](https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Iron_Ore), but more common than [gold
ore](https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Gold_Ore). It occurs at relatively low
levels in the world (layers 15-35). Lead ore veins are slightly smaller than
iron ore veins, and may contain one or two blocks of [silver
ore](/docs/thermal-foundation/ores/silver-ore/) as well. Similarly, silver ore
veins may contain one or two blocks of lead ore.

Lead ore must be mined with an [iron
pickaxe](https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Pickaxe) or better. If it is mined, it
drops itself as an item.
