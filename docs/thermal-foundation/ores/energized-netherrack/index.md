**Energized netherrack** is a rare
[ore](https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Ore){:target="_blank"} that can be found
in the [Nether](https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/The_Nether){:target="_blank"}.
It yields [energized
clathrate](/docs/thermal-foundation/materials/energized-clathrate/).


Obtaining
---------
Energized netherrack occurs rarely in the lower levels of the Nether (layers
10-40). It occurs in fairly large deposits, about as large as deposits of [coal
ore](https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Coal_Ore){:target="_blank"}. Deposits of
energized netherrack may also contain some [energized
glowstone](/docs/thermal-foundation/fluids/energized-glowstone/).

Energized netherrack must be mined with a [stone
pickaxe](https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Pickaxe){:target="_blank"} or better.
It drops one piece of [energized
clathrate](/docs/thermal-foundation/materials/energized-clathrate/) when mined.
More clathrate is dropped if a
[Fortune](https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Fortune){:target="_blank"} enchanted
pickaxe is used. The ore block itself can be obtained by mining it with a [Silk
Touch](https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Silk_Touch){:target="_blank"} enchanted
pickaxe.

When energized netherrack is broken, some [energized
glowstone](/docs/thermal-foundation/fluids/energized-glowstone/) comes flowing
out. This fluid cannot be picked up and eventually disappears.


Usage
-----
Energized netherrack yields [energized
clathrate](/docs/thermal-foundation/materials/energized-clathrate/) and
[sulfur](/docs/thermal-foundation/materials/sulfur/) when processed in a
[pulverizer](/docs/thermal-expansion/machines/pulverizer/). The clathrate can
then be further processed into [energized
glowstone](/docs/thermal-foundation/fluids/energized-glowstone/). Energized
netherrack can also be molten down into energized glowstone directly in a [magma
crucible](/docs/thermal-expansion/machines/magma-crucible/).
