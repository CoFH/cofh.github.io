**Mana infused ore** is an
[ore](https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Ore){:target="_blank"} that yields [mana
infused metal](/docs/thermal-foundation/metals-and-alloys/mana-infused-metal/).


Obtaining
---------
Mana infused ore does not occur in the world by default, and thus cannot be
legitimately obtained. However, it may be configured to generate in the world in
modpacks.

Mana infused ore must be mined with a [diamond
pickaxe](https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Pickaxe){:target="_blank"} or better.
If it is mined, it drops itself as an item.


Usage
-----
Mana infused ore yields [mana infused
metal](/docs/thermal-foundation/metals-and-alloys/mana-infused-metal/) and small
amounts of [gold](https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Gold){:target="_blank"} when
processed in a [pulverizer](/docs/thermal-expansion/machines/pulverizer/) or an
[induction smelter](/docs/thermal-expansion/machines/induction-smelter/). It
cannot be smelted in a furnace.
