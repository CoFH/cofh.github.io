**Mana infused ore** is an [ore](https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Ore) that is
unobtainable by default.


Obtaining
---------
Mana infused ore does not occur in the world by default, and thus cannot be
legitimately obtained. However, it may be configured to generate in the world in
modpacks.

Mana infused ore must be mined with a [diamond
pickaxe](https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Pickaxe) or better. If it is mined, it
drops itself as an item.


Usage
-----

Mana infused ore cannot be processed by
[smelting](https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Smelting).
