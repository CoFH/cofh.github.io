**Resonant end stone** is a fairly common
[ore](https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Ore){:target="_blank"} that can be found
in the [End](https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/The_End){:target="_blank"}. It
yields [resonant
clathrate](/docs/thermal-foundation/materials/resonant-clathrate/).


Obtaining
---------
Resonant end stone occurs fairly commonly at any level of the End (layers
10-80). It occurs in large deposits, slightly larger than deposits of [coal
ore](https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Coal_Ore){:target="_blank"}.

Resonant end stone must be mined with a [stone
pickaxe](https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Pickaxe){:target="_blank"} or better.
It drops one piece of [resonant
clathrate](/docs/thermal-foundation/materials/resonant-clathrate/) when mined.
More clathrate is dropped if a
[Fortune](https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Fortune){:target="_blank"} enchanted
pickaxe is used. The ore block itself can be obtained by mining it with a [Silk
Touch](https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Silk_Touch){:target="_blank"} enchanted
pickaxe.

When resonant end stone is broken, some [resonant
ender](/docs/thermal-foundation/fluids/resonant-ender/) comes flowing out. This
fluid cannot be picked up and eventually disappears. Due to the teleporting
effects of the fluid, players should be careful when mining resonant end stone.


Usage
-----
Resonant end stone yields [resonant
clathrate](/docs/thermal-foundation/materials/resonant-clathrate/) when
processed in a [pulverizer](/docs/thermal-expansion/machines/pulverizer/), which
can be further processed into [resonant
ender](/docs/thermal-foundation/fluids/resonant ender/). Resonant end stone can
also be molten down into resonant ender directly in a [magma
crucible](/docs/thermal-expansion/machines/magma-crucible/).
