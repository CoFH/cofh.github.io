**Resonant end stone** is a fairly common
[ore](https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Ore) that can be found in the
[End](https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/The_End).


Obtaining
---------
Resonant end stone occurs fairly commonly at any level of the End (layers
10-80). It occurs in large deposits, slightly larger than deposits of [coal
ore](https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Coal_Ore).

Resonant end stone must be mined with a [stone
pickaxe](https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Pickaxe) or better. It drops one piece
of [resonant clathrate](/docs/thermal-foundation/materials/resonant-clathrate/)
when mined. More clathrate is dropped if a
[Fortune](https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Fortune) enchanted pickaxe is used.
The ore block itself can be obtained by mining it with a [Silk
Touch](https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Silk_Touch) enchanted pickaxe.

When resonant end stone is broken, some [resonant
ender](/docs/thermal-foundation/fluids/resonant-ender/) comes flowing out. This
fluid cannot be picked up and eventually disappears. Due to the teleporting
effects of the fluid, players should be careful when mining resonant end stone.
