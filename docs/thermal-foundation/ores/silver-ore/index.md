**Silver ore** is a somewhat uncommon
[ore](https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Ore){:target="_blank"} that yields
[silver](/docs/thermal-foundation/metals-and-alloys/silver/).


Obtaining
---------
Silver ore is less common than [iron
ore](https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Iron_Ore){:target="_blank"}, but more
common than [gold
ore](https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Gold_Ore){:target="_blank"}. It occurs at
low levels in the world (layers 5-30). Silver ore veins are slightly smaller
than iron ore veins, and may contain one or two blocks of [lead
ore](/docs/thermal-foundation/ores/lead-ore/) as well. Similarly, lead ore veins
may contain one or two blocks of silver ore.

Silver ore must be mined with an [iron
pickaxe](https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Pickaxe){:target="_blank"} or better.
If it is mined, it drops itself as an item.


Usage
-----
Silver ore yields [silver](/docs/thermal-foundation/metals-and-alloys/silver/)
when processed, which is used to create various alloys and to build several
devices. If processed in a
[pulverizer](/docs/thermal-expansion/machines/pulverizer/) or an [induction
smelter](/docs/thermal-expansion/machines/induction-smelter/), it may also yield
small amounts of [lead](/docs/thermal-foundation/metals-and-alloys/lead/).

<!--
recipes:
  - smelting -> silver ingot
  - pulverizer (4000 RF) -> 2 silver dust & 1 lead dust (10%)
  - induction smelter with sand (4000 RF) -> 2 silver ingots & 1 rich slag (5%)
  - induction smelter with rich slag (4000 RF) -> 3 silver ingots & 1 slag (75%)
  - induction smelter with cinnabar (4000 RF) -> 3 silver ingots & 1 lead ingot
