**Silver ore** is a somewhat uncommon [ore](https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Ore)
that yields [silver](/docs/thermal-foundation/metals-and-alloys/silver/).


Obtaining
---------
Silver ore is less common than [iron
ore](https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Iron_Ore), but more common than [gold
ore](https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Gold_Ore). It occurs at low levels in the
world (layers 5-30). Silver ore veins are slightly smaller than iron ore veins,
and may contain one or two blocks of [lead
ore](/docs/thermal-foundation/ores/lead-ore/) as well. Similarly, lead ore veins
may contain one or two blocks of silver ore.

Silver ore must be mined with an [iron
pickaxe](https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Pickaxe) or better. If it is mined, it
drops itself as an item.


Usage
-----
Silver ore yields [silver](/docs/thermal-foundation/metals-and-alloys/silver/)
when processed, which is used to create various alloys and to build several
devices. If processed in a
[pulverizer](/docs/thermal-expansion/machines/pulverizer/) or an [induction
smelter](/docs/thermal-expansion/machines/induction-smelter/), it may also yield
small amounts of [lead](/docs/thermal-foundation/metals-and-alloys/lead/).
