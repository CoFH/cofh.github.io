**Platinum ore** is an
[ore](https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Ore){:target="_blank"} that yields
[platinum](/docs/thermal-foundation/metals-and-alloys/platinum/).


Obtaining
---------
Platinum ore does not occur in the world by default, and thus cannot be
legitimately obtained. However, it may be configured to generate in the world in
modpacks.

Platinum ore must be mined with a [diamond
pickaxe](https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Pickaxe){:target="_blank"} or better.
If it is mined, it drops itself as an item.


Usage
-----
Platinum ore yields
[platinum](/docs/thermal-foundation/metals-and-alloys/platinum/) when processed,
which is mostly used to create
[enderium](/docs/thermal-foundation/metals-and-alloys/enderium/). If processed
in a [pulverizer](/docs/thermal-expansion/machines/pulverizer/) or an [induction
smelter](/docs/thermal-expansion/machines/induction-smelter/), it may also yield
small amounts of [iridium](/docs/thermal-foundation/metals-and-alloys/iridium/).
