**Tin ore** is a common [ore](https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Ore) that yields
[tin](/docs/thermal-foundation/metals-and-alloys/tin/).


Obtaining
---------
Tin ore is about as common as [iron
ore](https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Iron_Ore), but it occurs at fewer levels
(layers 20-55). Veins of tin ore are also slightly smaller.

Tin ore must be mined with a [stone
pickaxe](https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Pickaxe) or better. If it is mined, it
drops itself as an item.
