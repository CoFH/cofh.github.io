**Tin ore** is a common
[ore](https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Ore){:target="_blank"} that yields
[tin](/docs/thermal-foundation/metals-and-alloys/tin/).


Obtaining
---------
Tin ore is about as common as [iron
ore](https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Iron_Ore){:target="_blank"}, but it occurs
at fewer levels (layers 20-55). Veins of tin ore are also slightly smaller.

Tin ore must be mined with a [stone
pickaxe](https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Pickaxe){:target="_blank"} or better.
If it is mined, it drops itself as an item.


Usage
-----
Tin ore yields [tin](/docs/thermal-foundation/metals-and-alloys/tin/) when
processed, which is used to build various devices and to create multiple alloys.
If processed in a [pulverizer](/docs/thermal-expansion/machines/pulverizer/) or
an [induction smelter](/docs/thermal-expansion/machines/induction-smelter/), it
may also yield small amounts of
[iron](https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Iron){:target="_blank"}.
