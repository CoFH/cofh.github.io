**Iridium ore** is an [ore](https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Ore) that is
unobtainable by default.


Obtaining
---------
Iridium ore does not occur in the world by default, and thus cannot be
legitimately obtained. However, it may be configured to generate in the world in
modpacks.

Iridium ore must be mined with a [diamond
pickaxe](https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Pickaxe) or better. If it is mined, it
drops itself as an item.


Usage
-----

Iridium ore cannot be processed by
[smelting](https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Smelting).
