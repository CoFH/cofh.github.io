**Iridium ore** is an [ore](https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Ore) that yields
[iridium](/docs/thermal-foundation/metals-and-alloys/iridium/).


Obtaining
---------
Iridium ore does not occur in the world by default, and thus cannot be
legitimately obtained. However, it may be configured to generate in the world in
modpacks.

Iridium ore must be mined with a [diamond
pickaxe](https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Pickaxe) or better. If it is mined, it
drops itself as an item.


Usage
-----
Iridium ore yields
[iridium](/docs/thermal-foundation/metals-and-alloys/iridium/) and small amounts
of [platinum](/docs/thermal-foundation/metals-and-alloys/platinum/) when
processed in a [pulverizer](/docs/thermal-expansion/machines/pulverizer/) or an
[induction smelter](/docs/thermal-expansion/machines/induction-smelter/). It
cannot be smelted in a furnace.
