**Nickel ore** is an uncommon [ore](https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Ore) that
yields [nickel](/docs/thermal-foundation/metals-and-alloys/nickel/) and
[platinum](/docs/thermal-foundation/metals-and-alloys/platinum/).


Obtaining
---------
Nickel ore is about as common as [gold
ore](https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Gold_Ore), but it occurs at fewer levels
(layers 5-20). Veins of nickel ore are also relatively small.

Nickel ore must be mined with an [iron
pickaxe](https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Pickaxe) or better. If it is mined, it
drops itself as an item.
