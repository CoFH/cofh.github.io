**Nickel ore** is an uncommon
[ore](https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Ore){:target="_blank"} that yields
[nickel](/docs/thermal-foundation/metals-and-alloys/nickel/) and
[platinum](/docs/thermal-foundation/metals-and-alloys/platinum/).


Obtaining
---------
Nickel ore is about as common as [gold
ore](https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Gold_Ore){:target="_blank"}, but it occurs
at fewer levels (layers 5-20). Veins of nickel ore are also relatively small.

Nickel ore must be mined with an [iron
pickaxe](https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Pickaxe){:target="_blank"} or better.
If it is mined, it drops itself as an item.


Usage
-----
Nickel ore yields [nickel](/docs/thermal-foundation/metals-and-alloys/nickel/)
when processed, which is mostly used to create
[invar](/docs/thermal-foundation/metals-and-alloys/invar/). If processed in a
[pulverizer](/docs/thermal-expansion/machines/pulverizer/) or an [induction
smelter](/docs/thermal-expansion/machines/induction-smelter/), it may also yield
small amounts of
[platinum](https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Gold){:target="_blank"}, a rare metal
that is used to create
[enderium](/docs/thermal-foundation/metals-and-alloys/enderium/).
