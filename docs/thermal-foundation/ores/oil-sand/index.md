**Oil sand** is an uncommon [ore](https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Ore) that
yields [bitumen](/docs/thermal-foundation/materials/bitumen/).


Obtaining
---------
Oil sand occurs fairly uncommonly in
[deserts](https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Desert) and similar biomes, in veins
between [sand](https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Sand),
[sandstone](https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Sandstone) and
[stone](https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Stone) blocks. It is found at almost any
altitude (layers 10-80). It occurs in fairly large deposits, almost as large as
deposits of [coal ore](https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Coal_Ore).

Oil sand also more rarely occurs in much larger deposits underground (layers
30-60), surrounding a small amount of [crude
oil](/docs/thermal-foundation/fluids/crude-oil/).

Oil sand must be mined with a [stone
pickaxe](https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Pickaxe) or better. It drops one piece
of [bitumen](/docs/thermal-foundation/materials/bitumen/) when mined. More
bitumen is dropped if a [Fortune](https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Fortune)
enchanted pickaxe is used. Oil sand itself can be obtained by mining it with a
[Silk Touch](https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Silk_Touch) enchanted pickaxe.

When oil sand is broken, some [crude
oil](/docs/thermal-foundation/fluids/crude-oil/) comes flowing out. This oil
cannot be picked up and eventually disappears.
