**Copper ore** is a common [ore](https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Ore) that
yields [copper](/docs/thermal-foundation/metals-and-alloys/copper/).


Obtaining
---------
Copper ore is slightly more common than [iron
ore](https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Iron_Ore), but it occurs at higher levels
(layers 40-96). Veins of copper ore are also slightly smaller. Below oceans,
copper ore less commonly occurs at deeper levels (layers 20-55).

Copper ore must be mined with a [stone
pickaxe](https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Pickaxe) or better. If it is mined, it
drops itself as an item.
