**Destabilized redstone ore** is a rare
[ore](https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Ore){:target="_blank"} that yields
[destabilized
clathrate](/docs/thermal-foundation/materials/destabilized-clathrate/).


Obtaining
---------
Destabilized redstone ore is relatively rare. It occurs underground at around
the same levels as [redstone
ore](https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Redstone_Ore){:target="_blank"} (layers
0-20). It occurs in fairly large deposits, almost as large as deposits of [coal
ore](https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Coal_Ore){:target="_blank"}. Deposits of
destabilized redstone ore may also contain some [destabilized
redstone](/docs/thermal-foundation/fluids/destabilized-redstone/).

Destabilized redstone ore must be mined with a [stone
pickaxe](https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Pickaxe){:target="_blank"} or better.
It drops one piece of [destabilized
clathrate](/docs/thermal-foundation/materials/destabilized-clathrate/) when
mined. More clathrate is dropped if a
[Fortune](https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Fortune){:target="_blank"} enchanted
pickaxe is used. The ore block itself can be obtained by mining it with a [Silk
Touch](https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Silk_Touch){:target="_blank"} enchanted
pickaxe.

When destabilized redstone ore is broken, some [destabilized
redstone](/docs/thermal-foundation/fluids/destabilized-redstone/) comes flowing
out. This fluid cannot be picked up and eventually disappears.


Usage
-----
Destabilized redstone ore yields [destabilized
clathrate](/docs/thermal-foundation/materials/destabilized-clathrate/) and
[cinnabar](/docs/thermal-foundation/materials/cinnabar/) when processed in a
[pulverizer](/docs/thermal-expansion/machines/pulverizer/). The clathrate can
then be further processed into [destabilized
redstone](/docs/thermal-foundation/fluids/destabilized-redstone/). Destabilized
redstone ore can also be molten down into destabilized redstone directly in a
[magma crucible](/docs/thermal-expansion/machines/magma-crucible/).
