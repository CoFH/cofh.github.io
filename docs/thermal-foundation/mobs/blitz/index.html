<p>
    <strong>Blitzes</strong> are hostile mobs that can be found in windy environments. They are air elementals, just like Blazes are fire elementals. They have an 'airy' look, and produce light-colored smoke particles. Blitzes make short breathing noises, as well as a noise that sounds like the wind.

<h2 id="behavior">Behavior</h2>
<p>
    When idle, Blitzes randomly wander around on the ground. When they see a player or a Villager, they start flying and attacking. Blitzes attack by shooting several airy bolts that can apply a nausea effect in addition to dealing damage. They then wait a few seconds before shooting again.
</p>

<h2 id="spawning">Spawning</h2>
<p>
    Blitzes can spawn in any Plains-like and/or sandy biomes in the Overworld, in spots with a light level of 8 or darker. They usually spawn in packs of 1-4. Packs of Blitzes are about ten times as rare as packs of mobs like Zombies, Skeletons, Spiders and Creepers. This means packs of Blitzes are about as rare as packs of Endermen.

<p>
    <strong>Note:</strong> Blitz spawning is very configurable. This page only describes how Blitzes spawn using the default settings.

<h2 id="drops">Drops</h2>
<p>
    When killed, Blitzes drop 0-1 piles of <a href="/docs/thermal-foundation/materials/niter/">Niter</a> and 0-1 <a href="/docs/thermal-foundation/elemental-materials/blitz-rod/">Blitz Rods</a>. They will drop more items if a sword with the Looting enchantment is used.<br />
    <a href="/docs/thermal-foundation/elemental-materials/blitz-rod/">Blitz Rods</a> can be used to create <a href="/docs/thermal-foundation/elemental-materials/blitz-powder/">Blitz Powder</a>, which is a critical ingredient for creating <a href="/docs/thermal-foundation/elemental-materials/aerotheum-dust/">Aerotheum Dust</a> and, ultimately, <a href="/docs/thermal-foundation/fluids/zephyrean-aerotheum/">Zephyrean Aerotheum</a>.
