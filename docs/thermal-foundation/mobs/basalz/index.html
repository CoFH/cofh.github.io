<p>
    <strong>Basalzes</strong> are hostile mobs that can be found in mountainous or barren environments. They are earth elementals, just like Blazes are fire elementals. They have a rocky look, and produce dark-colored dust particles. Basalzes make muffled breathing noises, as well as a noise that sounds like falling pieces of rock.

<h2 id="behavior">Behavior</h2>
<p>
    When idle, Basalzes simply 'walk' around on the ground. When they see a player or a Villager, they start flying and attacking. Basalzes attack by shooting several rocky bolts that can apply a weakness effect in addition to dealing damage. They then wait a few seconds before shooting again.
</p>

<h2 id="spawning">Spawning</h2>
<p>
    Basalzes can spawn in any mountainous and/or wasteland biomes in the Overworld, in spots with a light level of 8 or darker. They usually spawn in packs of 1-4. Packs of Basalzes are about ten times as rare as packs of mobs like Zombies, Skeletons, Spiders and Creepers. This means packs of Basalzes are about as rare as packs of Endermen.

    <strong>Note:</strong> Basalz spawning is very configurable. This page only describes how Basalzes spawn using the default settings.

<h2 id="drops">Drops</h2>
<p>
    When killed, Basalzes drop 0-1 piles of <a href="/docs/thermal-foundation/vanilla-materials/obsidian">Pulverized Obsidian</a> and 0-1 <a href="/docs/thermal-foundation/materials/basalz-rod">Basalz Rods</a>. They will drop more items if a sword with the Looting enchantment is used.<br />
    <a href="/docs/thermal-foundation/materials/basalz-rod">Basalz Rods</a> can be used to create <a href="/docs/thermal-foundation/materials/basalz-powder">Basalz Powder</a>, which is a critical ingredient for creating <a href="/docs/thermal-foundation/materials/petrotheum-dust">Petrotheum Dust</a> and, ultimately, <a href="/docs/thermal-foundation/fluids/tectonic-petrotheum">Tectonic Petrotheum</a>.
