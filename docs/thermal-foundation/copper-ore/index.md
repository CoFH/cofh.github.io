**Copper ore** is a common [ore](https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Ore) that
yields [copper](/docs/thermal-foundation/copper-ingot/) and small amounts of
[gold](https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Gold_Ingot).


Obtaining
---------

Copper ore is slightly more common than [iron
ore](https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Iron_Ore), but it occurs at higher levels
(layers 40-96). Veins of copper ore are also slightly smaller. Below oceans,
copper ore less commonly occurs at deeper levels (layers 20-55).

Copper ore must be mined with a [stone
pickaxe](https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Pickaxe) or better. If it is mined, it
drops itself as an item.

  default. The world generation can be tweaked or disabled using CoFH World's
  [configuration](/docs/cofh-world/world-generator-configuration/).
