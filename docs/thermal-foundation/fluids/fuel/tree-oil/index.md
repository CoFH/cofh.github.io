**Tree oil** is a fluid obtained by processing
[resin](/docs/thermal-foundation/fluids/tree/resin/) in a [fractionating
still](/docs/thermal-expansion/machines/fractionating-still/). It can be used as
fuel in a [compression
dynamo](/docs/thermal-expansion/dynamos/compression-dynamo/).


Obtaining
---------

### Fractionating Still
{% include recipe-table.html type='refinery' recipes=page.recipes.refinery %}

### Fluid Transposer
{% include recipe-table.html type='transposer-empty' recipes=page.recipes.transposer-empty %}


Usage
-----

Tree oil cannot be placed as a block.

### Fluid Transposer ingredient
{% include recipe-table.html type='transposer-fill' recipes=page.usage-recipes.transposer-fill %}

### Compression Dynamo fuel
When used as fuel in a [compression
dynamo](/docs/thermal-expansion/dynamos/compression-dynamo/), tree oil yields
1,000,000 RF per bucket.
