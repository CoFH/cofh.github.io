<blockquote>Liquifaction is salvation!</blockquote>

<p><strong>Liquifacted Coal</strong> is the result of melting down <a href="/docs/thermal-foundation/vanilla-materials/coal">Pulverized Coal</a> into a fluid. It is very flammable, and therefore the fluid is commonly used as fuel.</p>

<p>The following table lists some details of Liquifacted Coal. The same details for Water and Lava are included for comparison.</p>

{% include fluiddetails.html name='Liquifacted Coal' temperature=300 luminosity=0 density=900 viscosity=2000 %}

<h2 id="usage">Usage</h2>
<p>Liquifacted Coal has no use other than being usable as fuel in <a href="/docs/thermal-expansion/energy-production/compression-dynamo">Compression Dynamos</a> to produce <a href="/docs/redstone-flux">Redstone Flux</a>. However, this single use is very useful as it makes using Coal as fuel much more efficient.</p>

<h2 id="effects">Effects</h2>
<p>When placed, Liquifacted Coal flows similarly to the way Water flows, except a bit slower. The fluid can easily be set on fire. Flowing blocks of the fluid can be destroyed by fire, but source blocks cannot.</p>

<h2 id="drinking">Drinking</h2>
<p>Liquifacted Coal can be drunk using a <a href="/docs/minefactory-reloaded/tools/straw">Straw</a>. When done so, the player is given a Haste I potion effect that lasts for one minute.</p>
