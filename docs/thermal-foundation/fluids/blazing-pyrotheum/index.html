<blockquote>This is actually worse than lava. You monster.</blockquote>

<p><strong>Blazing Pyrotheum</strong> is a fluid that is produced when <a href="/docs/thermal-foundation/materials/pyrotheum-dust">Pyrotheum Dust</a> is molten down. It is the fire elemental fluid. The fluid is very, very hot, and is said to be worse than Lava.</p>

<p>The following table lists some details of Blazing Pyrotheum. The same details for Water and Lava are included for comparison.</p>

{% include fluiddetails.html name='Blazing Pyrotheum' temperature=4000 luminosity=15 density=2000 viscosity=1200 %}

<h2 id="usage">Usage</h2>
<p>Because of the extreme heat, Blazing Pyrotheum can be used to produce <a href="/docs/redstone-flux">Redstone Flux</a> using a <a href="/docs/thermal-expansion/energy-production/magmatic-dynamo">Magmatic Dynamo</a>. Other than that, it doesn't have much use (besides death traps).</p>

<h2 id="effects">Effects</h2>
<p>When Blazing Pyrotheum is placed down, the way it flows is very similar to the way Lava flows. However, it starts fires much more aggressively than Lava does. Source blocks of the fluid also gradually fall downwards if there are no blocks under them.</p>

<p>
    Blazing Pyrotheum also interacts in specific ways with some entities or blocks that it touches:
    <ul>
        <li>Any blocks that are flat on top get set on fire.</li>
        <li>Cobblestone gets turned into Stone.</li>
        <li>Grass Blocks get turned into Dirt.</li>
        <li>Sand gets turned into Glass.</li>
        <li>Clay Blocks get turned into Hardened Clay.</li>
        <li>Stone Stairs get turned into Stone Brick Stairs.</li>
        <li>Water and Ice get turned into Stone.</li>
        <li>Snow Blocks and Snow Covers are evaporated.</li>
        <li>Entities get hurt and set on fire, as if they were in Lava.</li>
        <li>Creepers instantly explode. Violently.</li>
    </ul>
</p>

<h2 id="drinking">Drinking</h2>
<p>Blazing Pyrotheum can be drunk using a <a href="/docs/minefactory-reloaded/tools/straw">Straw</a>. When done so, the player is dealt quite a bit of damage and gets set on fire for 30 seconds.</p>

<p>Why would you drink that?</p>
