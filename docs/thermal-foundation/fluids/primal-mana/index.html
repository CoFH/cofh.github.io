<blockquote>What is this I don't even?</blockquote>

<p><strong>Primal Mana</strong> is a fluid added by Thermal Foundation. Currently it cannot be obtained and has no real use whatsoever, though it is planned to be used in future mods.</p>

<h2 id="effects">Effects</h2>
<p>When placed, Primal Mana flows just like <a href="/docs/thermal-foundation/fluids/blazing-pyrotheum">Blazing Pyrotheum</a> does. Source blocks also gradually fall downwards if there are no blocks below them. Lastly, Primal Mana cannot be swum in. It can simply be walked through, as if it is not even there.</p>

<p>
    Primal Mana also interacts in specific ways with some entities or blocks that it touches:
    <ul>
        <li>Any blocks that are flat on top get set on fire, or get Snow Covers placed on top of them.</li>
        <li>Dirt gets turned into Grass Blocks.</li>
        <li>Coarse Dirt gets turned into Podzol.</li>
        <li>Glass or Stained Glass gets turned into Sand.</li>
        <li>Diamond Ore gets turned into <a href="/docs/thermal-foundation/world-generation/ores/#tin-ore">Tin Ore</a>.</li>
        <li>Cauldrons get turned into Orange Carpets.</li>
        <li>Cacti get turned into nearly completely eaten Cake blocks.</li>
        <li>Enchantment Tables get turned into Brewing Stands.</li>
        <li>Bookshelves get turned into Chests.</li>
        <li>Ender Chests get turned into <a href="/docs/thermal-foundation/fluids/resonant-ender">Resonant Ender</a> (cannot be picked up).</li>
        <li>Dragon Eggs get turned into Bedrock.</li>
        <li>Redstone Ore is set to glow and emit particles.</li>
        <li>Lapis Lazuli Ore gets turned into Lapis Lazuli Blocks.</li>
        <li>Farmland gets turned into Mycelium.</li>
        <li>Double Stone Slabs get turned into Smooth Double Stone Slabs.</li>
        <li><a href="/docs/thermal-foundation/base-metals/silver">Silver</a> (ore or storage blocks) gets turned into <a href="/docs/thermal-foundation/base-metals/mana-infused-metal">Mana Infused Metal</a>.</li>
        <li><a href="/docs/thermal-foundation/base-metals/lead">Lead</a> (ore or storage blocks) gets turned into <a href="/docs/thermal-foundation/vanilla-materials/gold">Gold</a>.</li>
        <li>Entities are randomly teleported around in a range of 8 blocks. Primal Mana does this less often than Resonant Ender does.</li>
    </ul>
