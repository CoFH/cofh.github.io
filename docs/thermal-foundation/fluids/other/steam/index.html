<p><strong>Steam</strong> is a fluid added by Thermal Foundation. The fluid currently only really exists within <a href="/docs/thermal-expansion/dynamos/steam-dynamo/">Steam Dynamos</a>. It can be placed in the world, but only by spawning in source blocks as there is no Steam Bucket.</p>

<p>Steam from other mods, <a href="http://www.railcraft.info">Railcraft</a> for example, may also be used instead of this version, if registered properly.</p>

<h2 id="effects">Effects</h2>
<p>Steam is currently not intended to be placed in the world. However, when it is placed using commands or cheats, Steam quickly flows upwards. It cannot be swum in; only walked through.</p>
