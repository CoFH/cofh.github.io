<blockquote>Behold, the Redstone Revolution!</blockquote>

<p><strong>Destabilized Redstone</strong> is a fluid that is produced when the structure of solid Redstone collapses under extreme heat. It is much better at conducting <a href="/docs/redstone-flux">Redstone Flux</a> than solid Redstone.</p>

<h2 id="usage">Usage</h2>
<p>Due to its high conductivity to Redstone Flux, Destabilized Redstone is often used to build advanced devices that can store or transport the energy. It is also a critical ingredient in creating the alloy <a href="/docs/thermal-foundation/alloys/signalum">Signalum</a> and the equipment from <a href="/docs/redstone-arsenal">Redstone Arsenal</a>. Lastly, Glowstone Dust or Snowballs can be infused with the fluid using a Fluid Transposer to create Blaze Powder or <a href="/docs/thermal-foundation/materials/blizz-powder">Blizz Powder</a>.</p>

<h2 id="effects">Effects</h2>
<p>When placed, Destabilized Redstone flows and can be swum in just like Water. It also emits a redstone signal, the strength of which depends on how far the emitting block is from the source block.</p>

<h2 id="drinking">Drinking</h2>
<p>Destabilized Redstone can be drunk using a <a href="/docs/minefactory-reloaded/tools/straw">Straw</a>. When done so, lightning strikes the player, setting them on fire for a short time. It also amplifies and extends any potion effects the player has, up to level IV for 8 minutes.</p>
