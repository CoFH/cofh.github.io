**Thermal Foundation** is one of the mods in the Thermal series. It provides all
the basic materials and tools that are used in the other mods in the series, as
well as ways to obtain them. It also provides new sets of weapons, tools and
armor made of various materials.

When Thermal Foundation is installed, several new features such as ores are
generated in the world using [CoFH World](/) (if installed).
This world generation can be tweaked or disabled using CoFH World's
[configuration](/docs/world-generator-configuration/).
