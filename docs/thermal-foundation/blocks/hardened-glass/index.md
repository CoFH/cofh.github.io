**Hardened glass** is a hard to break and explosion resistant version of
[glass](https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Glass). Variants of hardened glass exist
for every type of metal that Thermal Foundation provides.


Obtaining
---------

Hardened glass can only be harvested by dismantling it with a [crescent
hammer](/docs/thermal-foundation/items/crescent-hammer/) or by breaking it with
a [Silk Touch](https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Silk_Touch) enchanted pickaxe.

Usage
-----

### Light source
Some variants of hardened glass emit varying amounts of light depending on the
type of metal, like [lumium](/docs/thermal-foundation/ingots/lumium-ingot/).

### Beacons
Hardened glass changes the color of
[beacon](https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Beacon) beams. One hardened glass block
changes the color of a beacon beam to the color of the metal that corresponds to
the variant of hardened glass.
