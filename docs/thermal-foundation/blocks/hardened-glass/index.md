**Hardened glass** is a type of [glass](https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Glass)
that is hard to break and explosion resistant. It is made from
[lead](/docs/thermal-foundation/ingots/lead-ingot/) and [pulverized
obsidian](/docs/thermal-foundation/materials/pulverized-obsidian/) in an
[induction smelter](/docs/thermal-expansion/machines/induction-smelter/).
Hardened glass is commonly used to craft advanced devices.

Hardened glass can be further processed into variants for every metal and alloy
that Thermal Foundation provides. The difference between regular hardened glass
and these variants is purely cosmetic. Some of the variants do emit varying
amounts of light depending on the metal or alloy used, like
[lumium](/docs/thermal-foundation/ingots/lumium-ingot/).

Placed hardened glass blocks can only be harvested by dismantling them with a
[crescent hammer](/docs/thermal-foundation/items/crescent-hammer/), or by
breaking them with a tool enchanted with [Silk
Touch](https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Silk_Touch). They also change the color
of [beacon](https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Beacon) beams that shine through
them to the color of their corresponding metals.
