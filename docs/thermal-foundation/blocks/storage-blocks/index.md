**Storage blocks** are blocks that are crafted from metal or alloy
[ingots](/docs/thermal-foundation/materials/ingots/). They emit varying amounts
of light depending on the metal or alloy used, like
[lumium](/docs/thermal-foundation/metals-and-alloys/lumium/). They can also be
used to build [beacon](https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Beacon){:target="_blank"}
pyramids.
