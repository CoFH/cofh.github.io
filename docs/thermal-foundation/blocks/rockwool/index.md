**Rockwool** is a type of block added by Thermal Foundation. It is a special
type of [wool](https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Wool){:target="_blank"} produced
by smelting [slag](/docs/thermal-foundation/materials/slag/) in a furnace.
Rockwool is nearly identical to regular wool, except it isn't flammable. It is
also slightly more resistant to explosions (about as much as
[wood](https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Wood){:target="_blank"}).
