**Coal coke** is a material obtained by processing
[coal](https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Coal) in a [redstone
furnace](/docs/thermal-expansion/machines/redstone-furnace/) with [pyrolytic
conversion](/docs/thermal-expansion/augments/machine/pyrolytic-conversion/)
installed. It can be used as fuel, or as an ingredient to produce
[steel](/docs/thermal-foundation/items/materials/ingots/steel-ingot/).
