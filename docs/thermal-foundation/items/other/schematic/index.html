<p>The <strong>Schematic</strong> is a storage item added by Thermal Foundation. It is capable of storing a single crafting recipe for use in the <a href="/docs/thermal-expansion/machines/cyclic-assembler/">Cyclic Assembler</a> or <a href="/docs/thermal-expansion/devices/machinists-workbenches/">Machinist's Workbenches</a>.</p>

<h2 id="usage">Usage</h2>
<p>Crafting recipes may be written to a Schematic in the GUIs of the devices that can utilize the item. The Schematic is Ore Dictionary-aware: other than using the exact ingredients defined in stored recipes, the devices can also use equivalent items as ingredients.</p>

<p>Recipes stored on a Schematic may be wiped by using the item while sneaking. They can also be overwritten by simply writing another crafting recipe onto the Schematic.</p>

<p>Holding Shift causes written Schematics in inventories to display the items that are crafted with their recipes.</p>
