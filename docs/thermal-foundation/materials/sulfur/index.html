<p><strong>Sulfur</strong> is a type of dust added by Thermal Foundation. It can be obtained as a byproduct of processing Coal or various Nether-based materials in a <a href="/docs/thermal-expansion/machines/pulverizer">Pulverizer</a> or an <a href="/docs/thermal-expansion/machines/induction-smelter">Induction Smelter</a>.</p>

<h2 id="usage">Usage</h2>
<p>Sulfur is a critical component in the creation of <a href="/docs/thermal-foundation/materials/pyrotheum-dust">Pyrotheum Dust</a> and, ultimately, <a href="/docs/thermal-foundation/fluids/blazing-pyrotheum">Blazing Pyrotheum</a>. The material can also be used together with <a href="/docs/thermal-foundation/materials/niter">Niter</a> to create Gunpowder. Lastly, it can be used to craft <a href="/docs/thermal-expansion/storage/flux-capacitors">Flux Capacitors</a> in <a href="/docs/thermal-expansion">Thermal Expansion</a>.</p>
