<p><strong>Blitz Rods</strong> are mob drops added by Thermal Foundation. They are sometimes dropped when a <a href="/docs/thermal-foundation/mobs/blitz">Blitz</a> is killed. Essentially, they are the Blitz equivalent of Blaze Rods.</p>

<h2 id="usage">Usage</h2>
<p>Blitz Rods only have a single use: they can be crafted or <a href="/docs/thermal-expansion/machines/pulverizer">pulverized</a> into <a href="/docs/thermal-foundation/materials/blitz-powder">Blitz Powder</a>. This material is a critical ingredient for creating <a href="/docs/thermal-foundation/materials/aerotheum-dust">Aerotheum Dust</a> and, ultimately, <a href="/docs/thermal-foundation/fluids/zephyrean-aerotheum">Zephyrean Aerotheum</a>.</p>
