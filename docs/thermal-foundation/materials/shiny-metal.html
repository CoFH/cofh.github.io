<p><strong>Shiny Metal</strong> is one of the base metals added by Thermal Foundation. It is also the rarest of the base metals.</p>

<h2 id="usage">Usage</h2>
<p>Like most base metals in the mod, Shiny Metal can be used to craft tools and armor. Other than that, it does not serve much purpose, besides being a critical component in creating the powerful alloy <a href="/docs/thermal-foundation/alloys/enderium.html">Enderium</a>.</p>

<h2 id="naming">Naming</h2>
<p>The reason the metal is not called Platinum is because it is not part of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metals_of_antiquity" target="_blank">seven metals of antiquity</a>. Steve? doesn't know what to call the metal, resulting in the less 'logical' name Shiny Metal.</p>
