<p><strong>Cinnabar</strong> is a material added by Thermal Foundation. It can be obtained as a byproduct of processing <a href="/docs/thermal-foundation/world-generation/ores/#vanilla-ores">Redstone Ore</a> or, more rarely, <a href="/docs/thermal-foundation/world-generation/ores/#vanilla-ores">Gold Ore</a> in a <a href="/docs/thermal-expansion/machines/pulverizer">Pulverizer</a>.</p>

<h2 id="usage">Usage</h2>
<p>Cinnabar can be used together with certain ore blocks in an <a href="/docs/thermal-expansion/machines/induction-smelter">Induction Smelter</a>. When done so, the machine will produce three ingots as well as producing one guaranteed <a href="/docs/thermal-foundation/materials/ingots">Ingot</a> of whatever byproduct that ore has; if said byproduct is a kind of metal. This can be very useful for obtaining <a href="/docs/thermal-foundation/base-metals/shiny-metal">Shiny Metal</a> from <a href="/docs/thermal-foundation/world-generation/ores/#ferrous-ore">Ferrous Ore</a>, or obtaining <a href="/docs/thermal-foundation/base-metals/ferrous-metal">Ferrous Metal</a> from <a href="/docs/thermal-foundation/world-generation/ores/#vanilla-ores">Iron Ore</a>.</p>
