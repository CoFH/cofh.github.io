title: Storage Blocks

{% include materialformicons.html type='block' %}

<p><strong>Storage Blocks</strong> are a type of material added by vanilla Minecraft and Thermal Foundation. They are the largest units of metal; one Block of metal is worth nine <a href="/docs/thermal-foundation/materials/ingots">Ingots</a> of the same metal. Vanilla Minecraft and Thermal Foundation add Block types for all of their metals and alloys.</p>

<p>Storage Blocks can be placed in the world. They rarely have a use in crafting, if at all; they are mostly a compact and/or decorative way to store metals and alloys.</p>
