<p><strong>Niter</strong> is a type of dust added by Thermal Foundation. It can be obtained as a byproduct of processing Sandstone in a <a href="/docs/thermal-expansion/machines/pulverizer.html">Pulverizer</a>.</p>

<h2 id="usage">Usage</h2>
<p>Niter is a critical component in the creation of <a href="/docs/thermal-foundation/materials/cryotheum-dust.html">Cryotheum Dust</a> and, ultimately, <a href="/docs/thermal-foundation/fluids/gelid-cryotheum.html">Gelid Cryotheum</a>. The material can also be used together with <a href="/docs/thermal-foundation/materials/sulfur.html">Sulfur</a> to create Gunpowder. Lastly, it can be used to craft <a href="/docs/thermal-expansion/materials/phyto-gro.html">Phyto-Gro</a> for use in <a href="/docs/thermal-expansion/machines/phytogenic-insolator.html">Phytogenic Insolators</a> from <a href="/docs/thermal-expansion">Thermal Expansion</a>.</p>

<h2 id="naming">Naming</h2>
<p>Since Niter is essentially saltpeter, it may feel more logical to call the material 'Saltpeter Dust'. The reason behind the name 'Niter' is that it is actually a more accurate term for this material; '<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Niter" target="_blank">Niter</a>' is defined as the mineral form of saltpeter.</p>
