<p><strong>Blizz Powder</strong> is a material added by Thermal Foundation. It can be obtained by processing <a href="/docs/thermal-foundation/materials/blizz-rod">Blizz Rods</a>, just like Blaze Powder can be obtained by processing Blaze Rods. However, it can also be created by infusing Snowballs with <a href="/docs/thermal-foundation/fluids/destabilized-redstone">Destabilized Redstone</a> using a <a href="/docs/thermal-expansion/machines/fluid-transposer">Fluid Transposer</a>.

<h2 id="usage">Usage</h2>
<p>Blizz Powder only has a single use: it is a critical ingredient for creating <a href="/docs/thermal-foundation/materials/cryotheum-dust">Cryotheum Dust</a>, and, ultimately, <a href="/docs/thermal-foundation/fluids/gelid-cryotheum">Gelid Cryotheum</a>.</p>
