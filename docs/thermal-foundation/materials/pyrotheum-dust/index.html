<p><strong>Pyrotheum Dust</strong> is a type of dust added by Thermal Foundation. It is created from Redstone, Blaze Powder, <a href="/docs/thermal-foundation/vanilla-materials/coal">Pulverized Coal</a> and <a href="/docs/thermal-foundation/materials/sulfur">Sulfur</a>. The material is capable of producing extreme amounts of heat. It is the polar opposite of <a href="/docs/thermal-foundation/materials/cryotheum-dust">Cryotheum Dust</a>.</p>

<h2 id="usage">Usage</h2>
<p>Pyrotheum Dust has various uses. First of all, it can be molten down into <a href="/docs/thermal-foundation/fluids/blazing-pyrotheum">Blazing Pyrotheum</a>. It is also used in the Induction Smelter for certain processes that require extreme heat, like the creation of <a href="/docs/thermal-foundation/alloys/enderium">Enderium</a> or <a href="/docs/redstone-arsenal/materials/fluxed-electrum">Fluxed Electrum</a> Ingots, or directly smelting ore blocks into two ingots. Lastly, it can be crafted together with ore blocks to instantly 'smelt' them into one ingot of the material contained within.</p>
