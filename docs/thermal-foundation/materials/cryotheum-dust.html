<p><strong>Cryotheum Dust</strong> is a type of dust added by Thermal Foundation. It is created from Redstone, Snowballs, <a href="/docs/thermal-foundation/materials/niter.html">Niter</a> and <a href="/docs/thermal-foundation/materials/blizz-powder.html">Blizz Powder</a>. The material is capable of cooling things down to extreme temperatures very quickly. It is the polar opposite of <a href="/docs/thermal-foundation/materials/pyrotheum-dust.html">Pyrotheum Dust</a>.</p>

<h2 id="usage">Usage</h2>
<p>Cryotheum Dust has very few uses. The most important use, however, is melting the material down into <a href="/docs/thermal-foundation/fluids/gelid-cryotheum.html">Gelid Cryotheum</a>, which has more uses.</p>
