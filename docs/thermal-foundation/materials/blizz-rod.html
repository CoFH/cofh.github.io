<p><strong>Blizz Rods</strong> are mob drops added by Thermal Foundation. They are sometimes dropped when a <a href="/docs/thermal-foundation/mobs/blizz.html">Blizz</a> is killed by a player. Essentially, they are the Blizz equivalent of Blaze Rods.</p>

<h2 id="usage">Usage</h2>
<p>Blizz Rods only have a single use: they can be crafted or <a href="/docs/thermal-expansion/machines/pulverizer.html">pulverized</a> into <a href="/docs/thermal-foundation/materials/blizz-powder.html">Blizz Powder</a>. This material is a critical ingredient for creating <a href="/docs/thermal-foundation/materials/cryotheum-dust.html">Cryotheum Dust</a> and, ultimately, <a href="/docs/thermal-foundation/fluids/gelid-cryotheum.html">Gelid Cryotheum</a>.</p>
