<p><strong>Cinnabar</strong> is a material added by Thermal Foundation. It can be obtained as a byproduct of processing Redstone Ore or (more rarely) Gold Ore in a <a href="/docs/thermal-expansion/machines/pulverizer.html">Pulverizer</a>.</p>

<h2 id="usage">Usage</h2>
<p>Cinnabar can be used together with certain ore blocks in an <a href="/docs/thermal-expansion/machines/induction-smelter.html">Induction Smelter</a>. When done so, the machine will produce three ingots as well as producing one full ingot of whatever byproduct that ore has. This can be very useful for obtaining <a href="/docs/thermal-foundation/materials/shiny-metal.html">Shiny Metal</a> from <a href="/docs/thermal-foundation/world-generation/ores.html#ferrous-ore">Ferrous Ore</a>, or obtaining <a href="/docs/thermal-foundation/materials/ferrous-metal.html">Ferrous Metal</a> from <a href="/docs/thermal-foundation/world-generation/ores.html#vanilla-ores">Iron Ore</a>.</p>
