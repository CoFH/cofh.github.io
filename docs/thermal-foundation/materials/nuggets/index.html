{% include materialformicons.html type='nugget' %}

<p><strong>Nuggets</strong> are a type of material added by vanilla Minecraft and Thermal Foundation. They are the smallest units of metal; one Nugget of metal is worth a ninth of an <a href="/docs/thermal-foundation/materials/ingots/">Ingot</a> of the same metal. Vanilla Minecraft and Thermal Foundation add Nugget types for all of their metals and alloys.</p>

<p>Nuggets are somewhat commonly used in crafting; mostly when a metal is needed for a recipe, but using Ingots would make that recipe too expensive.</p>
