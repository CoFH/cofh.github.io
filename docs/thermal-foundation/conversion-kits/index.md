**Conversion kits** are items used to fully upgrade blocks to a given
[tier](/docs/tiers/). They can be obtained by combining [upgrade
kits](/docs/upgrade-kits/).

A creative conversion kit converts a block to its
[creative](/docs/tiers/#list-of-tiers) version. It cannot be legitimately
obtained in survival mode.

### Upgrading blocks
When used on an [upgradable block](/docs/tiers/#upgrading), a conversion kit
fully upgrades a block to a certain tier. This works regardless of the block's
current tier.
