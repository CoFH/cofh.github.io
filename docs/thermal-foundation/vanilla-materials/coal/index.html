<p><strong>Coal</strong> is a material added by vanilla Minecraft. Thermal Foundation adds a single item made of this material: Pulverized Coal.</p>

<h2 id="usage">Usage</h2>
<p>Coal is most commonly used as a basic solid fuel. The material can also be processed in a <a href="/docs/thermal-expansion/machines/pulverizer">Pulverizer</a> to produce Pulverized Coal and possibly <a href="/docs/thermal-foundation/materials/sulfur">Sulfur</a>. Pulverized Coal can be used as an ingredient to craft Gunpowder or <a href="/docs/thermal-foundation/materials/pyrotheum-dust">Pyrotheum Dust</a>. It can also be molten down in a <a href="/docs/thermal-expansion/machines/magma-crucible">Magma Crucible</a> to produce <a href="/docs/thermal-foundation/fluids/liquifacted-coal">Liquifacted Coal</a>.</p>
