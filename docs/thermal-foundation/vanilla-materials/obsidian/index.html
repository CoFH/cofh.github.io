<p><strong>Obsidian</strong> is a tough material added by vanilla Minecraft. It is the result of Water cooling down Lava source blocks. Thermal Foundation adds a single item made of this material: Pulverized Obsidian.</p>

<h2 id="usage">Usage</h2>
<p>Obsidian is a somewhat common ingredient in crafting. The material can also be processed in a <a href="/docs/thermal-expansion/machines/pulverizer">Pulverizer</a> to produce Pulverized Obsidian. This can be used as an ingredient to produce <a href="/docs/thermal-expansion/other/hardened-glass">Hardened Glass</a> or <a href="/docs/redstone-arsenal/materials/obsidian-rod">Obsidian Rods</a>. Obsidian can also be molten down in a <a href="/docs/thermal-expansion/machines/magma-crucible">Magma Crucible</a> to produce Lava.
