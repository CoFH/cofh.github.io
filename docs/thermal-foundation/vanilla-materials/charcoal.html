<p><strong>Charcoal</strong> is a material added by vanilla Minecraft. It is the result of burning Wood blocks in a Furnace. Thermal Foundation adds a single item made of this material: Pulverized Charcoal.</p>

<h2 id="usage">Usage</h2>
<p>Charcoal is most commonly used as a basic solid fuel. The material can also be processed in a <a href="/docs/thermal-expansion/machines/pulverizer.html">Pulverizer</a> to produce Pulverized Charcoal. This can be used as an ingredient to craft Gunpowder or <a href="/docs/thermal-expansion/materials/phyto-gro.html">Phyto-Gro</a>.
