<p><strong>Enderium</strong> is an advanced alloy added by Thermal Foundation. It consists of <a href="/docs/thermal-foundation/base-metals/tin">Tin</a>, <a href="/docs/thermal-foundation/base-metals/silver">Silver</a> and <a href="/docs/thermal-foundation/base-metals/shiny-metal">Shiny Metal</a> in a 2:1:1 ratio, with <a href="/docs/thermal-foundation/fluids/resonant-ender">Resonant Ender</a> added to the mix. The alloy is very strong, and requires <a href="/docs/thermal-foundation/materials/pyrotheum-dust">Pyrotheum Dust</a> to smelt into ingot form.</p>

<h2 id="usage">Usage</h2>
<p>Due to how strong the alloy is, Enderium is most commonly used to create the highest <a href="/docs/thermal-expansion/other/tier-system">tiers</a> of machines and devices in <a href="/docs/thermal-expansion">Thermal Expansion</a> and <a href="/docs/thermal-dynamics">Thermal Dynamics</a>. Other than that, it doesn't serve much purpose on its own.</p>
