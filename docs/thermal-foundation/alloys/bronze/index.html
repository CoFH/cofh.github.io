<p><strong>Bronze</strong> (previously known as <strong>Tinker's Alloy</strong>) is an alloy added by Thermal Foundation. It consists of <a href="/docs/thermal-foundation/materials/copper">Copper</a> and <a href="/docs/thermal-foundation/materials/tin">Tin</a> in a 3:1 ratio. Like Copper and Tin, the alloy is quite common in modded Minecraft.</p>

<h2 id="usage">Usage</h2>
<p>Bronze can be used to craft tools and armor. Tools and armor made of Bronze are very similar to their Iron counterparts, except twice as durable. Bronze is also an ingredient in various crafting recipes in <a href="/docs/thermal-expansion">Thermal Expansion</a>. It is particularly common in the recipes of the mod's Augments.</p>
