<p><strong>Lumium</strong> is an advanced alloy added by Thermal Foundation. It consists of <a href="/docs/thermal-foundation/materials/tin">Tin</a> and <a href="/docs/thermal-foundation/materials/silver">Silver</a> in a 3:1 ratio, with <a href="/docs/thermal-foundation/fluids/energized-glowstone">Energized Glowstone</a> added to the mix. The alloy gives off a bright glow that can be easily manipulated in controlled environments.</p>

<h2 id="usage">Usage</h2>
<p>Lumium is commonly used in devices that can emit (controllable) light. Currently the alloy doesn't have many uses in practice; in <a href="/docs/thermal-expansion">Thermal Expansion</a> there are only about three things that use Lumium in their crafting recipes.</p>
