<p><strong>Bronze</strong> is an alloy added by Thermal Foundation. It consists of <a href="/docs/thermal-foundation/materials/copper.html">Copper</a> and <a href="/docs/thermal-foundation/materials/tin.html">Tin</a> in a 3:1 ratio. Like Copper and Tin, the alloy is quite common in modded Minecraft.</p>

<h2 id="usage">Usage</h2>
<p>Bronze can be used to craft tools and armor. It is also an ingredient in various crafting recipes in <a href="/docs/thermal-expansion">Thermal Expansion</a>. It is particularly common in the recipes of the mod's Augments.</p>
