<p><strong>Signalum</strong> is an advanced alloy added by Thermal Foundation. It consists of <a href="/docs/thermal-foundation/materials/copper">Copper</a> and <a href="/docs/thermal-foundation/materials/silver">Silver</a> in a 3:1 ratio, with <a href="/docs/thermal-foundation/fluids/destabilized-redstone">Destabilized Redstone</a> added to the mix. The alloy is said to be very conductive.</p>

<h2 id="usage">Usage</h2>
<p>Signalum is commonly used in devices the functionality of which strongly depends on redstone control. It is also a common ingredient for crafting somewhat advanced devices in <a href="/docs/thermal-expansion">Thermal Expansion</a> and <a href="/docs/thermal-dynamics">Thermal Dynamics</a>. Lastly, it is a critical component for adding locks to machines and various devices in Thermal Expansion.</p>
