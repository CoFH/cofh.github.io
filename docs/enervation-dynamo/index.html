<p>The <strong>Enervation Dynamo</strong> is one of the Dynamos added by Thermal Expansion. It extracts <a href="/docs/redstone-flux/">Redstone Flux</a> from items that store it. These can be items that are designed to store energy like <a href="/docs/thermal-expansion/storage/energy-cells/">Energy Cells</a> or <a href="/docs/thermal-expansion/storage/flux-capacitors/">Flux Capacitors</a>, or natural sources of energy like Redstone.</p>

<p>When extracting energy from items that are designed to store it, the Dynamo is not affected by changes to its fuel efficiency caused by <a href="/docs/thermal-expansion/augments/dynamo-fuel-efficiency/">Fuel Efficiency</a> or <a href="/docs/thermal-expansion/augments/dynamo-power-output/">Power Output</a> <a href="/docs/thermal-expansion/augments/augmentation/">Augments</a>.</p>

<h2 id="power">Power</h2>
<p>The Enervation Dynamo extracts energy at a maximum rate of 80 RF per tick. This rate may decrease depending on how full the Dynamo's internal storage is, which can fill up if the Dynamo cannot emit its energy. The rate may be reduced down to a minimum of 8 RF per tick. At this point, extracted energy that cannot be stored anywhere is lost.</p>

<p>Installing the <a href="/docs/thermal-expansion/augments/dynamo-advanced-throttling/">Excitation Field Limiter</a> <a href="/docs/thermal-expansion/augments/augmentation/">Augment</a> removes this lower limit, allowing the Dynamo to automatically stop extracting energy completely if needed.</p>

<h2 id="input-output">Input/Output</h2>
<p>Energy extracted by the Enervation Dynamo is stored in the Dynamo's internal energy storage. It is then emitted as soon as possible in the direction in which the Dynamo's red coil is pointing. The Dynamo does not emit energy if it is inactive, even if some extracted energy is still stored in it.</p>

<p>The Dynamo accepts energy-containing items from external sources like Machines or <a href="/docs/thermal-dynamics/">Ducts</a>. These can be inserted on all sides of the Dynamo, except for the coil. However, if the <a href="/docs/thermal-expansion/augments/dynamo-side-accessibility/">Transmission Coil Ducting</a> <a href="/docs/thermal-expansion/augments/augmentation/">Augment</a> is installed, that side may also receive them.</p>

<h2 id="fuels">Fuels</h2>
<p>The below table lists the materials that the Enervation Dynamo can extract energy from. Materials that yield less energy are consumed more quickly.</p>
