title: CoFHTweaks
---

<p>
    <strong>CoFHTweaks</strong> is a coremod that brings various performance improvements to Minecraft. Some of them are configurable.
</p>

<p>
    Configuration options (defaults are the least disruptive to normal play):

    <ul>
        <li>Option to disable animated textures (higher fps)</li>
        <li>Option to disable dropped items attempting to stack (higher tps)</li>
        <li>Option to disable some entities pushing each other around (higher tps/fps)</li>
        <li>Option to defer client-side lighting updates when a block changes (higher fps)</li>
        <li>Option to make fewer entities render when tightly packed (higher fps)</li>
        <li>Option to reduce AI tick rate (higher average tps)</li>
    </ul>
</p>

<p>
    Non-configurable logic:

    <ul>
        <li>1.8 style occlusion - things that can't be seen aren't rendered (higher fps)</li>
        <li>Generally more efficient AI logic (higher tps)</li>
        <li>Non-pushable entities do not attempt to be pushed (higher tps)</li>
        <li>Faster chunk lookup (higher tps)</li>
    </ul>
</p>
