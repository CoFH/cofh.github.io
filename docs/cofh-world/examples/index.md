Here you will find one simple example for each [feature type](world-generator-configuration/feature-types/), [distribution type](world-generator-configuration/distribution-types/) and common format.

Every example includes:

- a brief description
- a link to the documentation
- a link to an example JSON file
- a gallery of images

The actual feature/distribution type and common format pages themselves, however, include many many more examples; this page is intended only to provide you with an overview.
