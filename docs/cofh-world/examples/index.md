Here you will find one simple example for each [feature](world-generator-configuration/feature-types/) and [distribution type](world-generator-configuration/distribution-types/).

Every example includes:

- a brief description
- a link to the documentation
- a link to an example JSON file
- a gallery of images

The actual feature and distribution type pages themselves, however, include many many more examples; this page is intended only to provide you with an overview.
