**`boulder`** is one of the [feature
types](/docs/cofh-world/world-generator-configuration/feature-types/) provided
by [CoFH World](/docs/cofh-world/). It generates groups of boulders, which are
nearly spherical deposits of blocks, like the [moss stone
boulders](https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Generated_structures#Moss_stone_boulder)
that are generated by default.

Boulders are only generated on the surface or underground. They are never
generated in midair.

The value `material` of a [feature type
configuration](/docs/cofh-world/world-generator-configuration/feature-format/#feature-type-configuration)
is only used to determine the position of boulders. When generating the boulders
themselves, any block may be replaced.


Options

When using this feature type, the following values must be added to the [feature
type
configuration](/docs/cofh-world/world-generator-configuration/feature-format/#feature-type-configuration).
