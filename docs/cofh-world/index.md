**CoFH World** is a mod that provides common world generation functionality for
the mods of Team CoFH. It also provides a configuration system that allows users
to define new types of features to generate in worlds.

[Thermal Foundation](/docs/thermal-foundation/) uses this mod for its world
generation by default.

The <span class="uk-badge">NEW</span> [Examples](/docs/cofh-world/examples/) page provides 
a great high-level overview of the mod and its capabilities, otherwise for a much more in-depth 
explanation check out the [Files](/docs/cofh-world/world-generator-configuration/files/) and [Feature Format](/docs/cofh-world/world-generator-configuration/feature-format/) sections.
