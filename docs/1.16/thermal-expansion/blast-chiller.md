A **blast chiller**, or **chiller** for short, is a
[machine](../machines/) that freezes fluids into items.

Obtaining
---------

A placed blast chiller can be instantly picked up by dismantling it with a
[crescent hammer](../../thermal-foundation/crescent-hammer/). It can also be
mined using a [pickaxe](https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki/Pickaxe) or by hand,
though this can be much slower.

When mined, its configuration, power, and augments are preserved in the item form.
Any items inside will drop, and any fluids will be voided. This behaviour can
be changed in the [configs](../../faq#configs).

Usage
-----

### Placement
When placed, a blast chiller faces the player. It can face any of the four
cardinal directions, and can be rotated using a
[crescent hammer](../../thermal-foundation/crescent-hammer/).

### Processing
A blast chiller has one input tank, one input slot, and one output slot.

When a blast chiller's input tank is filled with a fluid, the machine will start
consuming [Redstone Flux](/docs/redstone-flux/) to freeze it into an item.
Every processed item requires a certain amount of energy and fluid. When enough
energy has been consumed for an item, the input is consumed and the output is
placed in the output slot. [Casts](../../thermal-expansion/casts) may be used
to alter the shape of the end product.

An unaugmented blast chiller freezes fluids at a fixed 20 RF/t. If its
internal RF buffer runs out before the process is complete, the chiller stops
and the progress bar resets.

The processing speed of the blast chiller can be increased by installing 
[integral components](#augmentation) and certain [augments](#augmentation).

### Input and output
Fluids and items can enter and exit a blast chiller through any of its sides.
Every side of of a chiller may be configured to input items and fluids, output
items and fluids, or input and output at the same time. This is described in more
detail [here](../../thermal-expansion/machines#configuration).

A blast chiller can automatically transfer up to 1,000 mB of fluid and
up to 64 items at a time.

### Augmentation
A blast chiller can have augments installed to improve certain properties.
It can have a max of 4 augments installed.

Augments can be installed in the **Augmentation** tab in the blast chillerâ€™s GUI.
