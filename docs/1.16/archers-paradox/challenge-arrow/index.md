> Up for the challenge?

**Challenge Arrows** are special arrows that deal no damage. Successive hits will stack the "Archer's Gambit" effect. The further away your target is, the higher the effect will stack! When the effect timer runs out you'll receive the "Gambit Complete" effect, and gain XP proportional to the effect level up to a maximum of 500 XP. Missing the target will give the "Gambit Failed" effect, resetting "Archer's Gambit". 

Drops [training arrows](../../archers-paradox/training-arrow/) when they hit a target.
