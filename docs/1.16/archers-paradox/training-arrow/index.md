**Training Arrows** are practice arrows that deal no damage. Successive hits will stack the "Hit Streak" effect. The further away your target is, the higher the effect will stack! Missing the target will give the "Broken Streak" effect. Missing your target up close will incur a steeper penalty.

Trainging arrows can be reused indefinitely!
