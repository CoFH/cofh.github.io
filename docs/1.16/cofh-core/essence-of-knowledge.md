### Insightful Crystal
Essence of knowledge can be drained from an
[insightful crystal](../../thermal-foundation/insightful-crystal) that is holding
experience. This can be done by using the crystal on blocks that store fluids.

Conversely, using an [insightful crystal](../../thermal-foundation/insightful-crystal)
on a block storing essence of knowledge will fill the crystal.
