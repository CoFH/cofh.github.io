---

This is a brief summary of the special abilities of all equipment in Redstone Arsenal for 1.16. 

|Item|Unempowered|Empowered|
|---|---|---|
|Sword|---|Coalesces flux energy on the blade, releasing it as a piercing projectile when swung.|
|Shield|Blocks instances of flux damage.|When initially raised or upon blocking damage, releases a dispersion field that knocks nearby mobs and projectiles back.|
|Bow|---|Propels fired arrows at hyperspeed, often allowing them to reach their destinations instantly.|
|Crossbow|---|After a short charge up period, repeatedly fires up to 20 shots. Once the crossbow is released, it enters a cooldown period.|
|Quiver|Produces flux arrows that deal armor-piercing damage.|Produces arrows unaffected by gravity when shot from a bow, and arrows that explode on contact when shot from a crossbow.|
|Trident|---|When the user is off the ground, the trident can be swung to launch them downwards in the direction they are looking. Upon landing, the kinetic energy is used to deal armor piercing damage to nearby mobs, negating fall damage. Synergizes with the riptide enchantment.|
|Pickaxe|Can be used to charge the air with flux, producing a permanent light source. Using it on fluxed air will remove the effect. Using it while crouching will remove all fluxed air blocks in a large radius.|Automatically creates fluxed air when the user is in dark locations.|
|Axe|---|Critical damage is doubled and dealt as armor-piercing damage.|
|Shovel|Can be used on farmland or grass paths to revert them to dirt.|When used on dirt-type blocks, creates a flux-infused path block that is faster to walk on.|
|Hammer|---|Mining speed greatly reduced. Damage and attack speed increased. Hitting a mob grants the user 2s of speed. Using it on the ground creates a shockwave, which knocks affected mobs back, inflicts the sundered debuff on affected mobs, and grants the user a 2.5s strength buff. Hitting a mob while this buff is active will extend its duration by 0.5s.|
|Excavator|Can be used to place matching earth-type blocks in its area of effect.|Area of effect increased to 5x5.|
|Fishing Rod|---|Can be used to reel in hooked mobs with much greater control. The mob is unhooked if the user attacks it or uses the rod when crouching.| 
|Battle Wrench|Can be thrown, dealing damage to mobs and rotating blocks in its path. Returns after hitting something or when it is 16 blocks away from the user.|---|
|Elytra|Crouching in the air can be used to brake.|Uses flux energy to constantly propel the user, similar to continuously using firework rockets.|
|Elytra Controller|(Un)empowering the controller will also (un)empower the equipped elytra. When the equipped elytra is unempowered, using the controller will boost the user, similar to using a single firework rocket.|---|
|Flux Armor|Each piece grants a single charge of flux shielding. A charge can be used to negate a single instance of damage, up to 500 damage points. Charges regenerate after 30 seconds.|---|
