      <tr>
         <td>Pickaxe</td>
         <td>Can be used to charge the air with flux, producing a permanent light source. Using it on fluxed air will remove the effect. Using it while crouching will remove all fluxed air blocks in a large radius.</td>

         <td>Mining speed greatly reduced. Damage and attack speed increased. Hitting a mob grants the user 2s of speed. Using it on the ground creates a shockwave, which knocks affected mobs back, inflicts the sundered debuff on affected mobs, and grants the user a 2.5s strength buff. Hitting a mob while this buff is active will extend its duration by 0.5s.</td>

      <tr>
         <td>Armor</td>
