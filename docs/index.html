    <strong>Note:</strong> Crafting recipes may not always be up to date or matching with every modpack. It is encouraged to use mods like <a href="http://www.curse.com/mc-mods/minecraft/222211-notenoughitems" target="_blank">Not Enough Items</a> or <a href="http://www.curse.com/mc-mods/minecraft/craftguide" target="_blank">CraftGuide</a> to look up recipes live; this is usually much more accurate.
