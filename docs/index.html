    Welcome!<br />
    This section of the site contains documentation for the various Team CoFH mods for Minecraft. Click a link in the sidebar to begin.

    <strong>Note:</strong> The documentation does not contain crafting recipes. It is encouraged to use mods like <a href="http://www.curse.com/mc-mods/minecraft/222211-notenoughitems" target="_blank">Not Enough Items</a> or <a href="http://www.curse.com/mc-mods/minecraft/craftguide" target="_blank">CraftGuide</a> to look up recipes live. This is much more accurate than a manually updated list of recipes (that can quickly become invalid over time).
