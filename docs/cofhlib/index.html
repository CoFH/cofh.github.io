title: CoFHLib
---

<p>
    <strong>CoFHLib</strong>, also known as the <strong>CoFH Common Library</strong>, is a libary that allows Team CoFH and other modders to develop their mods more easily. CoFHLib provides a lot of the 'boring' yet essential code for creating mods. It is not actually a Forge mod in itself.
</p>

<p>
    CoFHLib also contains the <strong>CoFH API</strong>, which can be used to add compatibility with the various Team CoFH mods.
</p>

<p>
    <strong>Note:</strong> <a href="/mods/cofh-core">CoFH Core</a> includes CoFHLib in the mod file. As a result, it is not required or useful to install both CoFHLib and CoFH Core.
