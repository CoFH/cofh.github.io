<p>
    <strong>CoFHLib</strong>, also known as the <strong>CoFH Common Library</strong>, is a libary that allows modders to develop their mods more easily. CoFHLib provides a lot of the 'boring', yet essential code for creating mods. It is not actually a mod in itself, though.
</p>

<p>
    CoFHLib also contains the <strong>CoFH API</strong>, which may be used by other mods to integrate better with the various Team CoFH mods.

    <strong>Note:</strong> <a href="/docs/cofh-core/">CoFH Core</a> includes CoFHLib by default.
