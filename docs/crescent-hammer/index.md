> Any tool is a hammer if you really need one.


A **crescent hammer** is a tool that can be used to configure, rotate or
dismantle certain blocks.


Obtaining
---------

### Crafting
{% include recipe-table.html type='crafting' recipes=page.recipes.crafting no-result=true %}


Usage
-----

### Configuring and rotating
When used on a block, a crescent hammer will attempt to either configure it, or
rotate it 90 degrees. What 'configuring' a block means depends on the type of
block.

### Dismantling
When used on a block while the user is sneaking, a crescent hammer will attempt
to dismantle it. When dismantled, a block is instantly dropped as an item. This
only works on blocks that support it.

Most blocks in [Thermal Expansion](/docs/thermal-expansion/) and [Thermal
Dynamics](/docs/thermal-dynamics/) can be dismantled, as well as [hardened
glass](/docs/hardened-glass/).
