title: Tweaks
---

[CoFH Core](../) adds several **tweaks** to the game. Most of these are optional
and can be disabled.


Improved Feather Falling
------------------------

[Farmland](https://minecraft.wiki/w/Farmland) cannot be trampled by
players or mobs wearing [boots](https://minecraft.wiki/w/Boots) enchanted
with [Feather Falling](https://minecraft.wiki/w/Feather_Falling).


Improved Infinity
-----------------

[Bows](https://minecraft.wiki/w/Bow) enchanted with
[Infinity](https://minecraft.wiki/w/Infinity) work even if there are no
[arrows](https://minecraft.wiki/w/Arrow) in the user's inventory.


Improved Mending
----------------

The [Mending](https://minecraft.wiki/w/Mending) enchantment is altered so
that items are always repaired if possible, and the most damaged item is
repaired first.


Fishing exhaustion
------------------

*Disabled by default.*

[Fishing](https://minecraft.wiki/w/Fishing) can be configured to cause a
configurable amount of [exhaustion](https://minecraft.wiki/w/Hunger).
This can be used to discourage automatic fish farming.


Sapling growth modifier
-----------------------

*Disabled by default.*

[Sapling](https://minecraft.wiki/w/Saplings) growth can be configured to
be slowed by a configurable factor.


Item descriptions
-----------------

Descriptions for items can be added to localization files, using the same key as
the items plus `".desc"`. These descriptions are added to the items' tooltips.


Enchantment descriptions
------------------------

Descriptions for enchantments can be added to localization files, using the same
key as the enchantments plus `".desc"`. These descriptions are added to the
tooltips of [enchanted books](https://minecraft.wiki/w/Enchanted_Book).
