**Pyrotheum dust** is the fire elemental dust. It is most commonly used to make
[blazing pyrotheum](/docs/blazing-pyrotheum/). It can also be used to process
metal ores, and is used in several advanced crafting recipes.


Obtaining
---------

### Crafting
{% include recipe-table.html type='crafting' recipes=page.recipes.crafting no-result=true %}


Usage
-----

### Magma Crucible ingredient
{% include recipe-table.html type='crucible' recipes=page.usage-recipes.crucible %}

### Crafting ingredient
{% include recipe-table.html type='crafting' recipes=page.usage-recipes.crafting %}

### Centrifugal Separator ingredient
{% include recipe-table.html type='centrifuge' recipes=page.usage-recipes.centrifuge %}

### Fuel
When used as fuel in a [furnace](https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Furnace), one
piece of pyrotheum dust lasts 1,200 seconds, which is enough to smelt up to 120
items. It lasts just as long as [blaze
rods](https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Blaze_Rod).

### Reactant Dynamo fuel
When used together with 100 mB of [gelid cryotheum](/docs/gelid-cryotheum/) as
fuel in a [reactant dynamo](/docs/reactant-dynamo/), pyrotheum dust yields
400,000 RF per piece, or 500,000 RF if an [elemental
catalyzer](/docs/augment-elemental-catalyzer/) is installed.
