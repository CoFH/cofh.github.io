A **andesitic subduction** [augment](/docs/augments/) allows for an [igneous
extruder](/docs/igneous-extruder/) to produce
[andesite](https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Andesite) instead of
[stone](https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Stone).


Obtaining
---------

### Crafting
{% include recipe-table.html type='crafting' recipes=page.recipes.crafting no-result=true %}


Usage

### Installation
A andesitic subduction augment can be installed in the Augmentation tab in an
[igneous extruder](/docs/igneous-extruder/)'s GUI. It is a specialization that
cannot be installed together with other specialization augments.

### Effects
An installed andesitic subduction augment replaces an [igneous
extruder](/docs/igneous-extruder/)'s ability to produce
[stone](https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Stone) with the ability to produce
[andesite](https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Andesite).
