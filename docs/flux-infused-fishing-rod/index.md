### Crafting
{% include recipe-table.html type='crafting' recipes=page.recipes.crafting no-result=true %}


Usage
-----

### Charging
A flux-infused fishing rod can hold up to 320,000 [RF](/docs/redstone-flux/). It
can be charged using an [energetic infuser](/docs/energetic-infuser/) or
similar, or by touching a [fluxed electrum block](/docs/fluxed-electrum-block/)
or [flux crystal block](/docs/flux-crystal-block) while holding it. It can be
charged at rates up to 4,000 RF/t.

### Empowering
A charged flux-infused fishing rod can be empowered, increasing its power. This
can be toggled by pressing "Cycle Item Mode" (V by default).

### Fishing
A flux-infused fishing rod is as powerful as a regular [fishing
rod](https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Fishing_Rod) enchanted with [Lure
I](https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Lure) and [Luck of the Sea
I](https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Luck_of_the_Sea), and consumes 200 RF per
use. When empowered, it is as powerful as a regular fishing rod enchanted with
Lure III and Luck of the Sea III, and consumes 800 RF per use.

### Enchantments
A flux-infused fishing rod has an
[enchantability](https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Enchantability) of 25, which is
much higher than that of a regular [fishing
rod](https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Fishing_Rod). It can receive all the
enchantments that a regular fishing rod can receive.

When enchanted with [Unbreaking](https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Unbreaking), a
flux-infused fishing rod has a chance to not consume [Redstone
Flux](/docs/redstone-flux/) when used.

| Unbreaking level | No energy use chance |
|---
| I | 33% |
| II | 50% |
| III | 60% |

to increase its energy capacity.

| Holding level | Capacity multiplier |
|---
| I | × 1.5 |
| II | × 2 |
| III | × 2.5 |
| IV | × 3 |
