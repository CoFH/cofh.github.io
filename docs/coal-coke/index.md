**Coal coke** is a material obtained by processing
[coal](https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Coal) in a [redstone
furnace](/docs/redstone-furnace/) with [pyrolytic
conversion](/docs/augment-pyrolytic-conversion/) installed. It can be used as
fuel, or as an ingredient to produce [steel](/docs/steel-ingot/).

It lasts twice as long as regular [coal](https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Coal).
