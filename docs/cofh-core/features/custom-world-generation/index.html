title: Custom World Generation
redirect_from: /mods/cofh-core/custom-world-generation.html
---

<p>
    CoFH Core features a powerful customizable world generator. Using this feature, users or modpack authors can specify custom types of ores, plants, boulders, spikes, lakes and more to be generated in the world.
</p>

<p>
    <strong>Note:</strong> A good understanding of <a href="http://www.json.org/" target="_blank">JSON</a> is required. JSON terms will be used to describe the format of the configuration files.
</p>

<h2 id="file-structure">File structure</h2>

<p>
    Custom world generation is specified by <code>.json</code> files in the <code>cofh/world</code> folder inside Minecraft Forge's <code>config</code> folder. By default, this folder contains one or two files: <code>vanilla.json</code>, and <code>thermalfoundation_ores.json</code> if <a href="/docs/thermal-foundation/">Thermal Foundation</a> is installed.
</p>

<p>
    These files may be edited to change the default types of world generation. It is also possible to add new <code>.json</code> files to be read by CoFH Core. This is not required when adding more world generation types, but can improve readability for humans. The <code>world</code> folder is read recursively, so <code>.json</code> files may be grouped in folders for additional readability.
</p>

<p>
    Editing <code>vanilla.json</code> will only have effect if the option <code>ReplaceVanillaGeneration</code> is set to <code>true</code> in CoFH Core's configuration file. It is set to <code>false</code> by default.
</p>

<p>
    If world generation is not working as intended, try checking the log. Any errors that are found in the files are logged while the game starts.
</p>

<h2 id="file-format">File format</h2>

<p>
    Every world generation file consists of one root object. This object must contain a value <code>populate</code>, which describes the things to generate in the world. The object may also contain a value <code>dependencies</code>, describing what mods must be loaded in order to read the world generation file.
</p>

<h3 id="file-format-populate">populate</h3>

<p>
    The <code>populate</code> value is another object, whose values are <a href="#generation-entry-format">generation entries</a>. It describes the features to populate the world with.
</p>

<h3 id="file-format-dependencies">dependencies</h3>

<p>
    The <code>dependencies</code> value is either a single <a href="#forge-mod-entry">Forge mod entry</a>, or an array of them. If one of the specified dependencies is not loaded, the entire file will be skipped by CoFH Core.
</p>

<h2 id="generation-entry-format">Generation entry format</h2>

<p>
    A generation entry describes a feature to generate in the world. It is an object that can contain the following values.

                The <dfn>cluster</dfn> generator creates 'blobs' of blocks. This template is most commonly used for generating basic ore veins.<br />
                Minecraft generates ores and dirt/gravel pockets like this.
            </p>

            <ul>
                <li>
                    The <dfn>clusterSize</dfn> value in entries determines how large the blobs are. However, it is hard to determine how exactly it affects the amount of blocks generated. It is capped at 32, and will be interpreted as 32 if it has a higher number.<br />
                    For reference, have a look in the <a href="http://pastebin.com/uXuu9YJN" target="_blank">default vanilla.json file</a> to see examples of <dfn>clusterSize</dfn> values, and what the results of those entries are.

        <li>
            <p>
                The <dfn>sparse-cluster</dfn> generator is mostly the same as the <dfn>cluster</dfn> generator, with one notable exception. When using very small <dfn>clusterSize</dfn> values in entries (about 4 or less), clusters will only have a certain chance to actually generate, instead of generating a single block or so every time. At 3, 1 in 3 clusters will actually generate. At 2 it is 1 in 6 clusters, and at 1 it is 1 in 12 clusters.

        <li>
            <p>
                The <dfn>large-vein</dfn> generator can be used to create veins that have a (much) larger <dfn>clusterSize</dfn> than the <dfn>cluster</dfn> generator can handle.
            </p>

            <ul>
                <li>The <dfn>clusterSize</dfn> value in entries determines roughly how large veins are. Unlike <dfn>cluster</dfn>, there is no cap specified here. Use with caution.</li>

                            <td>Used to determine the shape and density of veins. If true, veins will be smaller and more spread out, and will look somewhat like neurons. The <dfn>clusterSize</dfn> value in entries then determines roughly how many blocks a single vein contains. If false, veins will be much larger and more dense, somewhat closer to how the <dfn>cluster</dfn> generator works. It is also hard to predict how the <dfn>clusterSize</dfn> value affects the resulting amount of blocks in this case, but it seems to be tied exponentially.</td>
