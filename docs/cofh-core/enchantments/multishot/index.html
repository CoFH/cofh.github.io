title: Multishot
---

<p><strong>Multishot</strong> is an enchantment added by CoFH Core. It can be applied to the Bows added by the Team CoFH mods. The enchantment makes these Bows shoot multiple arrows at once, at the cost of only one arrow at a time.</p>

<p>The amount of arrows fired at once is increased by one per enchantment level. The enchantment's maximum level is IV.</p>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> Multishot does not work on any type of Bow that does not have explicit support for it, including Bows from vanilla Minecraft.</p>
