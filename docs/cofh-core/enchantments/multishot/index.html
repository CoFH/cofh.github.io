title: Multishot
---

<p><strong>Multishot</strong> is a special enchantment added by CoFH Core. It can be applied to the various types of Bows that are added by the CoFH mods. The enchantment makes these types of Bows shoot multiple arrows at once, at the cost of only one arrow at a time. The enchantment's maximum level is IV.</p>

<p>The effects of the Multishot enchantment stack with those of the Infinity enchantment.</p>

<h2 id="usage">Usage</h2>
<p>The Multishot enchantment can be applied to <a href="/docs/thermal-foundation/equipment/reinforced-bows/">Reinforced Bows</a> from <a href="/docs/thermal-foundation/">Thermal Foundation</a> and <a href="/docs/redstone-arsenal/equipment/flux-infused-bow/">Flux-Infused Bows</a> from <a href="/docs/redstone-arsenal/">Redstone Arsenal</a>. It increases the amount of arrows fired at once by one per enchantment level.</p>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> Multishot does not work on any type of Bow that does not have explicit support for it. This includes Bows from vanilla Minecraft.</p>
