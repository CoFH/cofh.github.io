CoFH Core adds several new enchantments to the game, which can be applied to
various items provided by the CoFH mods.


Holding
-------
The Holding enchantment increases the storage capacity of certain items and
blocks that store things. Its maximum level is IV.

The following blocks and items can be enchanted with Holding:
* [Cache](/docs/thermal-expansion/storage/cache/)
* [Energy Cell](/docs/thermal-expansion/storage/energy-cell/)
* [Flux Capacitor](/docs/thermal-expansion/storage/flux-capacitor/)
* [Portable Tank](/docs/thermal-expansion/storage/portable-tank/)
* [Satchel](/docs/thermal-expansion/storage/satchel/)
* [Strongbox](/docs/thermal-expansion/storage/strongbox/)
* [Watering Can](/docs/thermal-cultivation/watering-can/)


Multishot
---------
The Multishot enchantment makes bows shoot multiple arrows at once, at the cost
of only one arrow. The amount of additional arrows fired per shot is equal to
the enchantment level. The enchantment's maximum level is IV.
