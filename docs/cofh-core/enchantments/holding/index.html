title: Holding
---

<p><strong>Holding</strong> is an enchantment added by CoFH Core. It can be applied to certain items and blocks that can store items. The enchantment increases the amount of inventory slots in said items and blocks by about 9 per level. The enchantment's maximum level is IV.</p>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> Applying Holding V or higher to these items by using commands or similar may crash the game upon trying to open them.</p>

<p>Currently the mods of Team CoFH do not provide any items that can be enchanted with Holding. However, they used to (Strongboxes and Satchels), and these items are planned to be reintroduced sometime soon.</p>
