**CoFH Core** is a mod that provides common functionality for the mods of Team
CoFH. It must be installed in order for the mods to run.

Other than providing common functionality for the other mods, CoFH Core also
provides a set of useful [commands](/docs/cofh-core/commands/), some
configurable [game tweaks](/docs/cofh-core/tweaks/), a [friend
list](/docs/cofh-core/friend-list/), and several new enchantments. It also notifies
players of updates for the CoFH mods.
