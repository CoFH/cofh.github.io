**CoFH Core** is a mod that provides common functionality for the mods of Team
CoFH. It must be installed in order for the mods to run.

Other than providing common functionality for the other mods, CoFH Core also
provides a set of useful [commands](/docs/cofh-core/commands/), several new
[enchantments](/docs/cofh-core/enchantments/), a [friend
list](/docs/cofh-core/friend-list/), and some configurable [game
tweaks](/docs/cofh-core/game-tweaks/). It also notifies players of updates for
the CoFH mods.
