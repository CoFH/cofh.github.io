A **structuralduct** is a decorative block that connects to most other ducts. It
is most commonly used to craft [covers](/docs/covers/).


Obtaining
---------

A placed structuralduct can be instantly picked up by dismantling it with a
[crescent hammer](/docs/crescent-hammer/). It can also be mined using a
[pickaxe](https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Pickaxe).
