**Rosin** is a byproduct of processing [resin](/docs/resin/) in a [fractionating
still](/docs/fractionating-still/). It can be used to craft
[torches](https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Torches), and can replace
[slimeballs](https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Slimeball) in some recipes.

### Fuel
When used as fuel in a [furnace](https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Furnace), one
piece of rosin lasts 40 seconds, which is enough to smelt up to 4 items.
