A **gearworking die** is an [augment](/docs/augments/) that allows for a
[compactor](/docs/compactor/) to efficiently produce metal gears.


Obtaining
---------

### Crafting
{% include recipe-table.html type='crafting' recipes=page.recipes.crafting no-result=true %}


Usage
-----

### Installation
A gearworking die can be installed in the Augmentation tab in a
[compactor](/docs/compactor/)'s GUI. It is a specialization that cannot be
installed together with other specialization augments.

### Effects
An installed gearworking die allows for a [compactor](/docs/compactor/) to be
switched into Gear mode. In this mode, the compactor produces metal gears from
metal ingots and blocks. The center [iron
ingots](https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Iron_Ingot) that are used when manually
crafting gears are not required.
