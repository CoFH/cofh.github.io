An **Upgrade Kit** is an upgrade for machines added by Thermal Expansion. An
upgrade kit can only be used to upgrade one tier. Upgrade Kits can be combined
to make a [Conversion Kit](/docs/conversion-kits/) that can upgrade multiple
tiers at once.

An Upgrade Kit is applied by right clicking on the machine you want to upgrade.
