**Vanilla+ Satchels** is a mod in the Vanilla+ Series that provides
[satchels](/docs/vanillaplus-satchels/satchel/). These are items that store
other items, and are able to automatically store picked up items. They are
functionally identical to the [satchels](/docs/thermal-expansion/satchel/)
provided by [Thermal Expansion](/docs/thermal-expansion/), but are made of
materials that are available in the base game.
