A **closed-loop cooling** [augment](/docs/augments/) allows for a [compression
dynamo](/docs/compression-dynamo/) to work without consuming the
[coolant](/docs/coolants/) it holds.


Obtaining
---------

### Crafting
{% include recipe-table.html type='crafting' recipes=page.recipes.crafting no-result=true %}


Usage
-----

### Installation
A closed-loop cooling augment can be installed in the Augmentation tab in a
[compression dynamo](/docs/compression-dynamo/)'s GUI. It is a specialization
that cannot be installed together with other specialization augments.

### Effects
A [compression dynamo](/docs/compression-dynamo/) with closed-loop cooling
installed does not consume any [coolant](/docs/coolants/) when active. However,
at least some coolant must be present in the dynamo for it to work.
