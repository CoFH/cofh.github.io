    Allows for a redstone furnace to process various plant-based materials into
    <a href="https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Charcoal">charcoal</a>, and <a

    coke</a>. <a
    href="/docs/thermal-foundation/fluids/fuel/creosote-oil/">Creosote oil</a>
    is also produced as a byproduct. However, only these items can be processed,
    and the machine's maximum power usage (speed) is reduced by a factor of 10.
